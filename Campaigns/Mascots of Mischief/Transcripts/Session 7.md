[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:19.280]  So, you'll be traveling that direction alone. Have you rolled today to see if you've gone
[00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.000]  down a hunger level?
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:30.560]  Yep. Willpower, if I'm not mistaken, correct?
[00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:31.560]  Correct.
[00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:32.560]  That's a failure.
[00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.560]  If you like to spend a lot of points, they are daily.
[00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:38.560]  I don't know if they do that.
[00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:41.560]  Nah, I'll leave it.
[00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:42.560]  Okay.
[00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:43.560]  Um.
[00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:44.560]  Okay.
[00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:53.800]  You will have to travel at night then because of sunlight.
[00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.560]  Okay.
[00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:13.920]  So, you begin making your way towards Karpatch.
[00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.960]  Thankfully you finished your mission.
[00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.240]  Most of your mission was inside.
[00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.960]  So, you are traveling at night at this point.
[00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:28.280]  And the good thing about being a vampire is you only need to sleep.
[00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:29.280]  Yep.
[00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:40.280]  So, you go through from about 6pm, 6.30 when the sun goes down, to dawn.
[00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.360]  So, 12 hours.
[00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.160]  You're traveling a lot faster than most would.
[00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.320]  Just because of that.
[00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.840]  And quadruped also helps.
[00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:51.840]  Yep.
[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.040]  And you double your movement speed.
[00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.040]  Yep.
[00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:01.520]  So, I basically end up, whenever I dash, I get to add double.
[00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.720]  So, it would be 13 plus 26.
[00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.760]  Damn.
[00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:10.720]  Okay.
[00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.920]  Because normal dash rules is you just get your thing.
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.720]  But as quadruped, I double that.
[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:17.720]  So it would be 26.
[00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.520]  I want to say there's a thing you can do with stamina.
[00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:23.520]  There is.
[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:29.960]  It's full, which then would end up making my movement speed a total of 52.
[00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:33.080]  God damn.
[00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.080]  Quadruped man.
[00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.040]  Um, yeah.
[00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.040]  Jesus Christ.
[00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.040]  Uh, yeah, so, you wouldn't be doing that the entire time though.
[00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:49.040]  No, not for sprint, but dash I could do for a while.
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:57.040]  Yeah, I guess you could.
[00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:06.040]  Uh, so...
[00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:14.040]  I'm saying it's nothing, but it didn't run it.
[00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.040]  It did what we do.
[00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.040]  And you're a tiny creature, correct?
[00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.040]  I am tiny.
[00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:26.040]  Okay, I need to keep that in mind because, uh, I didn't realize I get a minus 20 to hit
[00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.040]  you.
[00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.040]  Yep.
[00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.040]  Minus 20 for attack rolls on me.
[00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.040]  Yep.
[00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.040]  Standard size.
[00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.040]  Yeah.
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.040]  I'm gonna go with that.
[00:03:37.040 --> 00:04:05.040]  Uh...
[00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:13.040]  Alright, uh, yeah, so you can basically cut this in half.
[00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:14.040]  Easily.
[00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.040]  Just moving.
[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:20.040]  Uh, and not necessarily expending too much.
[00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.040]  Um...
[00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:23.040]  Huh?
[00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:29.040]  Uh, you know what, that's a good point since you were traveling for a good 12 hours versus
[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:34.040]  what most people would have to do to rest.
[00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:44.040]  You turn this five day trip into about three and a half.
[00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:49.040]  That uh, that halfway point where there's only about half a day left, that's probably when
[00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:52.040]  I'll think that, uh, that's roll.
[00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:53.040]  Okay.
[00:04:53.040 --> 00:05:01.040]  So, um, you will travel for that first day, half of the second night you will come into
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:10.040]  Skalingrad, um, and then you'll travel from Skalingrad to Kvatch.
[00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:14.040]  I'll take a bite to eat while I'm in Stalingrad.
[00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.040]  I figured you would.
[00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:17.040]  Um, okay.
[00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:22.040]  So, you easily are able to, uh, slip into the gates.
[00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:23.040]  Um...
[00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:26.040]  You're just a cat.
[00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:31.040]  Most people aren't going to look at you twice.
[00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:32.040]  Um...
[00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:38.040]  Go ahead and give me an observation check to look for someone to feed on.
[00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:46.040]  Oh, I already posted a, uh, an appropriate gift.
[00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:51.040]  I keep failing these observation tests.
[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:53.040]  Okay.
[00:05:53.040 --> 00:06:00.040]  Um... most people in this point...
[00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:01.040]  Wait.
[00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:12.040]  Luck would have it, there are a lot of refugees in Skalingrad right now.
[00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:17.040]  Nobody really inside, but I find somebody kind of like in the wayside type situation.
[00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:18.040]  Yep.
[00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:21.040]  Leave me in an alleyway.
[00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:24.040]  Make me a stealth check.
[00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:32.040]  I am much better at those.
[00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:38.040]  Oh my god, no, no, no, no, Luck, um, no.
[00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:40.040]  Why do you hate me?
[00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:41.040]  One degree.
[00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:42.040]  Oh, finally.
[00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:45.040]  Something at least.
[00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:53.040]  Uh, easily enough you're able to go through alleyways looking for, uh, courtyards where
[00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:56.040]  a lot of the refugees have found themselves sleeping.
[00:06:56.040 --> 00:07:02.040]  Um, just from talks you can hear that they are headed towards, uh, the Imperial City,
[00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:05.040]  but they're staying here for the night.
[00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:10.040]  Um, can we continue in the morning?
[00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:26.040]  Um, within, uh, ten minutes or so you're able to find, uh, a lone guy taking it, or sleeping
[00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:27.040]  in the alley.
[00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:33.040]  He's taking the blankets to be given to him by the Legion, as well as, uh, some of his
[00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:36.040]  personal effects, try to make a makeshift pallet to sleep on.
[00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:46.040]  And, um, you come across to, across him as he's starting to drift into sleep.
[00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:52.040]  I'll feed, uh, just enough in order to get well fed so I have a small buffer.
[00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:53.040]  Okay.
[00:07:53.040 --> 00:08:00.040]  Um, and that is...
[00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:08.040]  Okay, go ahead and roll the hit.
[00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:13.040]  Uh, bonus for the stealth or...
[00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:17.040]  Uh, if you want to actually, I think this is considered a coup de grace.
[00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:18.040]  I'm just double checking.
[00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:32.040]  Something to be aware of just for the future, coup de grace.
[00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:33.040]  Um...
[00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:34.040]  It just...
[00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:35.040]  Oh, okay.
[00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:36.040]  Yeah.
[00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:37.040]  Uh, so roll the amateur.
[00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:46.040]  Uh, guy's not wearing armor so that pierces through.
[00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:52.040]  Uh, deals enough for you to get well fed.
[00:08:52.040 --> 00:09:11.040]  And, um, he will make a observation check with a penalty.
[00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:21.040]  Uh, with an 88 he does not pass.
[00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:30.240]  He, uh, just kind of, kind of tries to like swat it like a bug on his neck and turns over
[00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:34.540]  and goes back to sleep.
[00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:40.040]  And back off I go, where I eventually open the scroll.
[00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:52.400]  He'll, uh, be out there just about a half days away at this point as he's been basically
[00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:56.400]  debating with himself this whole time whether he's supposed, whether he should look at it
[00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:58.100]  or not.
[00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:03.800]  Not only that, but if it says that he's going to be looking in the scroll anyways, then
[00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:06.600]  what's the point in even trying to fight it?
[00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:14.760]  Is this going to end up affecting his deal with the Hermora, the spirit god of knowledge
[00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:16.760]  or what?
[00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:25.760]  He keeps fighting against himself until eventually he decides to listen to what the moth priest
[00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:28.180]  ended up saying in the end.
[00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:35.320]  That apparently this was meant to be and what will happen will happen.
[00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:41.800]  And with that he will finally pull it out of the wet bag that he was given.
[00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:48.040]  Hesitate for a moment before opening it and seeing what's in.
[00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:59.920]  See what they have for when you try to read one.
[00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:03.480]  Right now I'm picturing Kung Fu Panda when he's looking at the dragon scroll.
[00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:04.480]  It's nothing!
[00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:05.480]  It's blank.
[00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:08.480]  We wish it was blank.
[00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:16.480]  Sorry we got Maddie to watch that yesterday and now it's in my head and it's all that
[00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:20.680]  I'm picturing.
[00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:26.640]  Alright, let's move for this.
[00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:28.520]  Okay.
[00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:34.480]  Oh!
[00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:36.440]  Okay.
[00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:37.440]  So.
[00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:38.440]  Sandra.
[00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:39.440]  Yes?
[00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:48.120]  I am going to go ahead and preface this.
[00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:52.240]  You are going to want to pass this check.
[00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:53.240]  Okay.
[00:11:53.240 --> 00:12:00.280]  If you need to burn luck to do so, I would recommend it.
[00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:02.280]  Yeah, I figured as much.
[00:12:02.280 --> 00:12:08.160]  I will read what it says.
[00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:15.320]  You people are capable of reading and interpreting altrolls successfully while escaping and escaped.
[00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:19.080]  Characters who attempt this must make a -30 willpower test.
[00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:20.080]  Ouch.
[00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:27.360]  If they succeed, they gain the blindness condition for 1d8 days.
[00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:31.000]  On a failure, they are blinded permanently.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.000]  Mmm, okay.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.480]  You want to pass this check.
[00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:41.920]  Yes I do.
[00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:45.160]  The way you would mitigate this is you took the elite advance, Moth Priest, but there's
[00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:52.160]  literally two talents for it in your only purpose of ever reading.
[00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:59.160]  One second.
[00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:04.080]  Okay.
[00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:14.240]  Go ahead and remove the project.
[00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:18.000]  If you want to use the roller.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.000]  I'm using the roller.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.120]  I always use the roller.
[00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:25.360]  It may screw me over sometimes, but every once in a while I get that good one.
[00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:31.200]  Oh, either lucky number or please hit at least somewhere.
[00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:35.320]  I only have a 10% chance on this.
[00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:36.320]  That's one no.
[00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:47.240]  I'm going to use a luck point.
[00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:48.240]  Holy shit.
[00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:49.240]  Yeah.
[00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:55.000]  Not only did I succeed, I got a lucky number.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.000]  Yes.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.000]  Nice.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.040]  Roll me an intelligence check.
[00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:02.280]  Yes.
[00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:05.200]  With a plus 20.
[00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:09.240]  With a plus 20, okay.
[00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:10.240]  Plus 20.
[00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:11.880]  No, that's equals 20.
[00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:12.880]  Plus 20.
[00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:15.320]  That is still equals 20.
[00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:19.040]  There we go.
[00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:22.040]  No degrees but success.
[00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:23.040]  Heart.
[00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:24.040]  Heart.
[00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:25.040]  My heart.
[00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:41.720]  I did this earlier.
[00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:47.880]  I'm gonna see if I can't find it in the chat and repost it again.
[00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:52.120]  Yeah, here it is.
[00:14:52.120 --> 00:15:00.960]  Heart back in general.
[00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:02.760]  I saw that earlier.
[00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:09.400]  I wrote that out myself because why not?
[00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:10.400]  Do it.
[00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:23.920]  I'm gonna speak a little tag.
[00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:32.520]  Do the hell speak, please.
[00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:33.520]  That was concerning.
[00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:34.520]  Oh, it was.
[00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:37.520]  Oh, I missed the googly eyes.
[00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:46.560]  Oh, my God.
[00:15:46.560 --> 00:16:05.840]  You kind of find a small path off to the side of the road and for a minute there you
[00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:08.520]  start fighting with this thought of bringing the Elder Scroll.
[00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:10.920]  You've heard of how dangerous it is.
[00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:15.520]  You saw the Monk Priests with their bandaged eyes essentially.
[00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:19.360]  But curiosity got the better of you.
[00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:25.080]  And you know what curiosity does to cats.
[00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:32.920]  But satisfaction brings them back.
[00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:40.120]  The Elder Scroll unfurls with the sound of bone splintering.
[00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:51.280]  The air around you in this small little clearing in the woods thickens, heavy and suffocating
[00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:56.600]  as if every one of your breaths is borrowed.
[00:16:56.600 --> 00:17:03.440]  You just writhe across the parchment like living slipping free of the prison and crawling
[00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:08.640]  into your eyes.
[00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:13.920]  First you were cast into a battlefield of ash and ruin.
[00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:21.520]  For you you see burning, rebuilt and burning again.
[00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:22.520]  Okay.
[00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:27.360]  Okay, okay, okay.
[00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:30.680]  Every cycle worse than the last.
[00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:34.120]  Daedric gates spear open like wounds in the world.
[00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:39.720]  In veins of living flesh crawl through its foundations, pulsing as though Narn itself
[00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:42.720]  were becoming a body.
[00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:48.320]  Then you see your friend, Mitha.
[00:17:48.320 --> 00:18:03.280]  His form buckles beneath the weight of wings made of bone, his body scarred by the marks
[00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:06.400]  that he received in Cold Harbor.
[00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:11.360]  He staggers across a desolate plain under Cold Harbor's black sky, his eyes bright with
[00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:13.160]  fury yet pleading with despair.
[00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:20.880]  For a brief moment they walk on yours before he is swallowed, screaming by the shifting
[00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:22.880]  ground.
[00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:30.800]  The vision cracks, shatters and in the shards another thread pulses through.
[00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:37.120]  An Altmer woman, her features cold and proud, stand before a yawning oblivion gate, fire
[00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:43.120]  light wreathing like a crown, though her lips never move, her voice pierces you and for
[00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:49.520]  the first time in your life you hear this, not in your mind, but it's a weird sensation
[00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:53.440]  especially for you.
[00:18:53.440 --> 00:19:05.760]  A whisper of ruin, a promise that she will be the one to begin the unmaking of Narn.
[00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:09.160]  The flashes of scenes and images strike like lightning.
[00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:16.160]  You see Mitha lashing out against unseen chains, his cries echoing across shadowed halls.
[00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:20.680]  The Altmer woman lifting her bloodstained hands in devotion to something beyond the
[00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:21.680]  gate.
[00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:30.680]  A white gold tower crowned by a black sun and an impossibly large scale, trembling like
[00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:35.360]  the heartbeat of the world.
[00:19:35.360 --> 00:19:44.560]  The scroll slams shut, furling back closed and you hear a click as the metal handles
[00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:50.720]  on either side shift into place.
[00:19:50.720 --> 00:20:01.980]  Your ears are ringing with the chorus of whispers.
[00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:11.320]  You pull your paw up to your eyes and you can feel the blood dripping from them collecting
[00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:19.400]  in your fur.
[00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:47.480]  And that heavy air seems to lift and you can breathe again.
[00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:52.680]  -30 willpower.
[00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:59.080]  On a success, you are blinded for D8 days.
[00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:03.600]  On a failure, you gain the blinded condition permanently.
[00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:07.840]  Speaking of, let me go ahead and roll that D8.
[00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:08.840]  Three.
[00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:12.640]  He's going to be blinded when he gets to the party.
[00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:16.600]  Well, if it's only a D8, then it's probably...
[00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:17.600]  Three days.
[00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:23.360]  I have no idea how Tessendra's supposed to...
[00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:28.840]  Because of the lucky number that you rolled on that willpower check.
[00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:29.840]  I did somehow...
[00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:31.840]  You will not be blinded.
[00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:38.840]  Okay, we'll say that the lucky number is somehow what saved Tessendra.
[00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:44.020]  Well, yeah, I mean, to be fair, like, in the game, the protagonist reads them all the time
[00:21:44.020 --> 00:21:47.000]  and doesn't go blind, I guess it's just kind of luck.
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.820]  You never read it.
[00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:53.280]  Notice in Skyrim, your eyes never look at the Elder Scrolls.
[00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:54.560]  Well, okay, that's not true.
[00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:55.560]  But it's also...
[00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:58.920]  You look at it and then you stop immediately.
[00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:02.920]  Two of the times, there are three Elder Scrolls in Skyrim total.
[00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:05.480]  Two of them.
[00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:08.160]  One is read by a moth priest using a ritual.
[00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:10.120]  And he goes blind.
[00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:12.000]  Well, yeah, and he goes blind.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:20.480]  And the other was put into a Dwemer machination to be able to decipher.
[00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:21.480]  Yeah.
[00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:26.960]  And you only use that one to travel through time because you're just reading it where
[00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:28.960]  it already made a wound in time.
[00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:32.360]  And the other one you read with all the moths.
[00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:33.360]  Yep.
[00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:35.520]  But technically, you never do.
[00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:42.760]  The one person who ever sees properly read it is...I can't remember his actual name,
[00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:44.440]  but it's the great fox in 4.
[00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:45.440]  Yeah.
[00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:46.440]  Sorry, I'm very late.
[00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:47.440]  I had to move...
[00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:48.440]  Oh.
[00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:49.440]  Fair enough.
[00:22:49.440 --> 00:22:53.280]  There was a second too.
[00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:58.120]  But yeah, I was literally driving to go drop my friend off so I could make it here and
[00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:01.760]  we drove by those literally on the curb about to be picked up by the dump truck and we're
[00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:02.760]  like, "Nope!"
[00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:12.840]  So in overall, what is it that Decentra is learning from this scroll?
[00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:14.880]  There are attacks on the oblivion gates.
[00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:17.560]  Getting ready to happen?
[00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:20.440]  You saw the oblivion gates open.
[00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:31.320]  You heard a whisper of ruin, a promise that she would be the one to unmake Nirn.
[00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:35.480]  She...
[00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:42.560]  That's the thing.
[00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:46.400]  Living gate...our Elder Scrolls are never going to tell you directly.
[00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:47.400]  Yep.
[00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:48.400]  Unfortunately.
[00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:54.840]  But with that information, he'll take the remainder of his day and not as easily continue
[00:23:54.840 --> 00:24:00.400]  to make his way back towards the perfectly fine party who has had no issues whatsoever
[00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:01.400]  this whole time.
[00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:02.400]  I don't know whatsoever.
[00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:03.400]  No!
[00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:04.400]  Alright, so...
[00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:05.400]  Everything's fine!
[00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:16.400]  I had a week to prepare myself.
[00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:18.560]  You continue on your journey.
[00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:22.560]  Still seeing the flashes of images.
[00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:34.360]  With the arrest of the party.
[00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:40.600]  The last thing that I believe happened was...
[00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:41.600]  You all watched...
[00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:44.200]  Last thing you said was, "I heard you have some questions."
[00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:45.200]  Yep.
[00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:50.200]  Specifically, Vespera...Vespera of Somerset.
[00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:56.600]  I heard you had some questions for me.
[00:24:56.600 --> 00:25:03.280]  Yeah, here's the thing.
[00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:07.920]  My character is gonna...
[00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:13.680]  She's in complete shock.
[00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:15.800]  She's all messed up.
[00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:18.800]  As she should be.
[00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:28.760]  She...it might take a moment or two or even a minute before she gets up.
[00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:32.360]  Kinda not really breathing.
[00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:40.320]  It just kinda not feels real right now because she just lost somebody.
[00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:54.680]  Go to Mitho's body and Nils, closing his eyes, and not saying anything for a moment.
[00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:57.840]  Hey guys, apparently my phone's frozen.
[00:25:57.840 --> 00:25:58.840]  Oh!
[00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:01.440]  Oh, you okay?
[00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:07.760]  I'm fine, my phone is not liking Discord right now, so...
[00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:10.680]  I just joined on my computer but don't have a camera at the moment.
[00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:11.680]  It's totally fine.
[00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:12.680]  That's fine.
[00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:20.640]  Alright, I'm gonna restart my phone and see if that fixes the problem.
[00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:25.000]  Did I only miss Tessendra doing things or did we escape from the ravine?
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:30.680]  Would you like me to reread what Tessendra experienced?
[00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:36.000]  Was it being warned that the Oblivion gates are gonna open?
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:37.000]  There are multiple things.
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:38.000]  Okay.
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:49.960]  If you don't mind, I'm gonna take a quick second to do that so Macy's caught up.
[00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:53.360]  First you were cast into a battlefield of ash and ruin.
[00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:56.840]  Kvatch burns, rebuilt, and burns again.
[00:26:56.840 --> 00:26:59.360]  Every cycle worse than the last.
[00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:02.000]  Daedric gates spear open like wounds in the world.
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:05.840]  In veins of living flesh crawl through its foundations, pulsing as though Nurn itself
[00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:09.200]  were becoming a body.
[00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:11.080]  Then you see Mitho.
[00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:17.680]  His form buckles beneath the weight of wings made of bone, his body scarred by the marks
[00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:20.520]  he received in Cold Harbor.
[00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:25.640]  He staggers across a desolate plain under Cold Harbor's black sky, his eyes bright with
[00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:29.240]  fury yet pleading with despair.
[00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:35.760]  For a second they lock on yours before he is swallowed, screaming by the shifting ground.
[00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:40.240]  The vision cracks, shatters, and in the shards another thread pulses through.
[00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:47.080]  An Altmer woman, her features cold and proud, stands before a yawning Oblivion gate.
[00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:52.200]  Firelight wreathes her like a crown, though her lips never move, her voice pierces you
[00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:58.920]  with a whisper of ruin, a promise that she will be the one to begin the unmaking of Nurn.
[00:27:58.920 --> 00:27:59.920]  This is the part where I came in.
[00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:00.920]  Nope.
[00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:03.920]  Oh, this is, uh, this is, I skipped this part so this is where I was going.
[00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:07.640]  Oh!
[00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:11.280]  This is not Mitho's fate.
[00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:12.840]  This is another.
[00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:14.240]  Another's path.
[00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:19.280]  Another doom unfurling far away yet the scroll insists on showing you both.
[00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:27.080]  Two threads swolving into the same tapestry of disaster.
[00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:29.160]  Flashes strike like lightning.
[00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:34.160]  Mitho lashing out against unseen chains, his cries echoing across the shadowed halls.
[00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:39.080]  The Altmer woman lifting her bloodstained hand in devotion to something beyond the gate.
[00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:42.000]  The white gold tower crowned by a black sun.
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:55.680]  An impossibly large scale trembling like the heartbeat of the world on the brink.
[00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:56.680]  And then cut to me.
[00:28:56.680 --> 00:29:00.040]  And then cut back to this bro.
[00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:04.840]  Which, you see my character.
[00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:10.400]  Kind of ignoring the pillar.
[00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:11.400]  Complete shock.
[00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:14.680]  It takes a moment.
[00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:22.200]  Even a minute before she, huh, gone to Mitho's body.
[00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:25.200]  Close his eyes.
[00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:36.120]  And just looking down and not really saying anything.
[00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:43.680]  Aspera, I think we need to go.
[00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:46.200]  She was mine to have.
[00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:49.200]  I didn't realize it.
[00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:56.200]  Until it was too late.
[00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:59.200]  I think this is a play on the heart.
[00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:02.200]  I think this is a play on the heart.
[00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:05.200]  I think this is a play on the heart.
[00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:08.200]  I think this is a play on the heart.
[00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:12.200]  I think this is a play on the heart.
[00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:15.200]  I think this is a play on the heart.
[00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:19.200]  Until it was too late.
[00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:26.200]  I think this is a place mortals were not meant to be.
[00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:30.200]  Perfectly fine scary healer.
[00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:31.200]  Yeah.
[00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:36.200]  She looks up at the pillar.
[00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:45.200]  And it's like, Hadeya Samara wants to know about your blood, your pain surgery.
[00:30:45.200 --> 00:30:59.200]  You want to know about you.
[00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:18.200]  And she does take a hold of Mitho and taking her tugging on his clothes like trying to ground herself, but there's nothing to ground herself with.
[00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:23.200]  Is there even enough left of Mitho to recommend Mitho to them?
[00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:36.200]  His external body is mostly untouched, but as Vespera goes to move him.
[00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:38.200]  Jelly.
[00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:41.200]  In a lot of places.
[00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:44.200]  I was going for the snow day by the way.
[00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:46.200]  Shattered.
[00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:51.200]  Pieces fragments you can feel it grinding against itself.
[00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:54.200]  I do.
[00:31:54.200 --> 00:32:02.200]  I am tugging, I am holding on to the cloak right here though.
[00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:05.200]  You know how you hold on to something.
[00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:06.200]  Yeah.
[00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:07.200]  Yeah.
[00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:08.200]  That.
[00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:10.200]  Is she at least if you're dead.
[00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:11.200]  Yes.
[00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:13.200]  Okay, good.
[00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:21.200]  But I do tell him like, there's more I wants to know about you.
[00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:33.200]  My eyes and my eyes are slightly closed, tears forming, stinging her eyes, not really looking up.
[00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:38.200]  Well.
[00:32:38.200 --> 00:32:49.200]  It was an experiment for people like him.
[00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:59.200]  Your friend Mitho kept me alive as they grafted me to the stonework here.
[00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:06.200]  They wanted to make something that could outlive their race.
[00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:12.200]  And it seems I have.
[00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:18.200]  Maybe not.
[00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:21.200]  I was a slave.
[00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:36.200]  I was a prisoner.
[00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:37.200]  One of you.
[00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:42.200]  People in this city have been going missing for years.
[00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:46.200]  Feeding me.
[00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:55.200]  Since the fateful day when Pelinal came and wiped out your species, our species.
[00:33:55.200 --> 00:33:57.200]  So you're a lead.
[00:33:57.200 --> 00:34:04.200]  Was.
[00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:27.200]  And as as he says that one of the tendrils pearls out of the wall.
[00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:35.200]  I'm cracking.
[00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:37.200]  I'm kind of shell shocked right now.
[00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:41.200]  So I look at it and look at the pillar.
[00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:45.200]  Now I'm all of this.
[00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:48.200]  I'm in every building.
[00:34:48.200 --> 00:34:50.200]  Every piece of stonework.
[00:34:50.200 --> 00:34:56.200]  Every cobblestone.
[00:34:56.200 --> 00:35:11.200]  And yeah, how do you.
[00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:13.200]  So I guess there's more.
[00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:15.200]  Probably want to know how long.
[00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:22.200]  You can't think you can stay awake and be like this.
[00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:25.200]  Because thousand years.
[00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:27.200]  You never slept.
[00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:28.200]  Right.
[00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:33.200]  Wake the whole time.
[00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:37.200]  And what knowledge would that bring.
[00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:47.200]  So I can get to her desk.
[00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:50.200]  The flesh shapers of old.
[00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:52.200]  Or cake.
[00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:57.200]  Very much holistic and what they did.
[00:35:57.200 --> 00:36:00.200]  When you take.
[00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:06.200]  The belief, the religion out of it.
[00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:12.200]  It's quite beautiful.
[00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:25.200]  What you can do.
[00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:27.200]  To a body.
[00:36:27.200 --> 00:36:29.200]  I have spent.
[00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:31.200]  So much time done here.
[00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:33.200]  Amassing the energies.
[00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:35.200]  The emotions.
[00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:39.200]  Of people above.
[00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:49.200]  Things you fought.
[00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:54.200]  They were citizens here.
[00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:57.200]  You.
[00:36:57.200 --> 00:37:01.200]  One came from years ago.
[00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:03.200]  A woman.
[00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:09.200]  Newly married.
[00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:13.200]  I took her.
[00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:18.200]  The widower came down looking for.
[00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:22.200]  Track to where she went.
[00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:24.200]  And I rejoined them.
[00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:31.200]  Into one.
[00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:37.200]  That's not right.
[00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:39.200]  Sickness and health.
[00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:47.200]  Right.
[00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:49.200]  What do you say.
[00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:52.200]  In sickness and health.
[00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:53.200]  Right.
[00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:55.200]  I go saying like.
[00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:56.200]  I'm going to kill this dude.
[00:37:56.200 --> 00:37:57.200]  Right.
[00:37:57.200 --> 00:38:02.200]  I'm going to kill this dude.
[00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:04.200]  You do not know how much.
[00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:06.200]  There's so much.
[00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:08.200]  They're not evil.
[00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:12.200]  I promise.
[00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:14.200]  You woke this thing up.
[00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:16.200]  I didn't know.
[00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:18.200]  This thing.
[00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:20.200]  Yelling his.
[00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:24.200]  Face while he was asleep.
[00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:28.200]  I didn't know.
[00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:30.200]  I didn't do it.
[00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:32.200]  Yep.
[00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:34.200]  So.
[00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:39.200]  I'm going to stand up.
[00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:46.200]  And I go saying like.
[00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:48.200]  I need to tell.
[00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:50.200]  More.
[00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:56.200]  How do you manage to stay awake for a thousand years.
[00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:58.200]  Can't sleep.
[00:38:58.200 --> 00:39:00.200]  You know why.
[00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:03.200]  Most people will die if they.
[00:39:03.200 --> 00:39:06.200]  Stay forever.
[00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:10.200]  I think this thing counts as a person anymore.
[00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:12.200]  Do I have eyelids.
[00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:17.200]  Do I even have a brain.
[00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:21.200]  Do you have a heart.
[00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:23.200]  Do you even have eyes.
[00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:25.200]  Nope.
[00:39:25.200 --> 00:39:27.200]  As far as you can tell nope.
[00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:29.200]  I go like.
[00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:31.200]  You have a hand.
[00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:33.200]  You have other.
[00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:35.200]  Appendages and body parts.
[00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:37.200]  Unless that was not yours.
[00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:39.200]  They're not mine.
[00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:41.200]  Of course they are.
[00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:43.200]  I go to the pillar.
[00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:45.200]  What do you mean that.
[00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:47.200]  I have eyes.
[00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:49.200]  Don't you.
[00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:53.200]  So I'm going to go over to the pillar.
[00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:57.200]  This is not a place people were meant to be.
[00:39:57.200 --> 00:39:59.200]  I'm not listening to you.
[00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:01.200]  No she's not talking to you.
[00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:03.200]  She wants to leave.
[00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:07.200]  Clearly you have something to say to this.
[00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:14.200]  I'm going to be taking the dagger out of my hair.
[00:40:14.200 --> 00:40:19.200]  And walking over to the pillar and stabbing it.
[00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:22.200]  Okay.
[00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:29.200]  I had a way to think about how she would react.
[00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:32.200]  But it doesn't have any properties.
[00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:40.200]  She can't really hurt him at all.
[00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:42.200]  It's more out of frustration.
[00:40:42.200 --> 00:40:49.200]  And it is kind of noticeable with how she's been talking.
[00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:53.200]  She knows she can't hurt him.
[00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:57.200]  Does it care?
[00:40:57.200 --> 00:41:05.200]  It's just one simple stab and leaving it in there.
[00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:07.200]  You're leaving the dagger in there?
[00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:09.200]  Yeah at least for right now.
[00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:13.200]  I don't pull it back out immediately unless he goes saying something.
[00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:16.200]  He can easily push it out.
[00:41:16.200 --> 00:41:17.200]  Probably.
[00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:19.200]  Feel better?
[00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:32.200]  You took something away from me that I didn't even know I had.
[00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:39.200]  And you've been taking from the city for a thousand years.
[00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:48.200]  At this point I would gladly just turn your miserable life because what good do you actually do for the city?
[00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:50.200]  Do you protect it?
[00:41:50.200 --> 00:41:54.200]  Obviously not.
[00:41:54.200 --> 00:42:05.200]  I'd be good to go into pain so sweet or to try to live up to the expectation of my race.
[00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:07.200]  Maybe not so much anymore.
[00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:16.200]  Unless if that's the gift you're willing to give.
[00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:20.200]  It really is a beautiful art.
[00:42:20.200 --> 00:42:22.200]  It's horrifying.
[00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:26.200]  You say I took him from you?
[00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:28.200]  Yes.
[00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:32.200]  Look in the room you're in.
[00:42:32.200 --> 00:42:38.200]  Look at the pillar that you are talking to.
[00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:43.200]  I can't die.
[00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:49.200]  Do you want to die?
[00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:52.200]  I don't know.
[00:42:52.200 --> 00:43:03.200]  But your friend here helped take myself away from me.
[00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:11.200]  I have been here feeding, trying to fight against the urges.
[00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:16.200]  At a certain point I stopped giving a fuck.
[00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:20.200]  Maybe I'll ask Hodeus to end you.
[00:43:20.200 --> 00:43:28.200]  At least give you a mercy killing.
[00:43:28.200 --> 00:43:35.200]  And I'm being actually kind right here.
[00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:46.200]  And I hope you go to Aethelia or whatever planes you are willing to go to when you perish.
[00:43:46.200 --> 00:43:51.200]  It sounds genuine when it says it doesn't know if it wants to die.
[00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:56.200]  I'm trying to get it out.
[00:43:56.200 --> 00:44:09.200]  If you can show me your heart, I'll kill you Alan Mercy.
[00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:11.200]  You say that?
[00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:22.200]  You watch as the flesh around the pillar, as well as the flesh on the walls, begin to grow spines?
[00:44:22.200 --> 00:44:26.200]  Just stand there and move slightly.
[00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:37.200]  The pillar opens up and you see...
[00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:43.200]  To call it a heart is not a heart.
[00:44:43.200 --> 00:44:55.200]  I think I know what you need to look at to get a good idea for this.
[00:44:55.200 --> 00:45:07.200]  You see multiple hearts, different shapes, sizes, all grafted together.
[00:45:07.200 --> 00:45:18.200]  And you watch as the spines from itself curve inward and stab into it.
[00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:27.200]  And the spines break off and meld back into it.
[00:45:27.200 --> 00:45:30.200]  Good luck.
[00:45:30.200 --> 00:45:38.200]  I'm tired.
[00:45:38.200 --> 00:45:49.200]  I'm going to use the 8-Lit little thing but I gotta go saying I got a question.
[00:45:49.200 --> 00:46:04.200]  Exactly, before I do anything, what do you think? Why Penis O3 is beautiful in you guys? Any last words before I even try to attempt?
[00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:08.200]  Something to check the messages.
[00:46:08.200 --> 00:46:20.200]  It can be used to make things even the gods couldn't.
[00:46:20.200 --> 00:46:32.200]  It can be used to heal, to regrow limbs, to make something into something it's not.
[00:46:32.200 --> 00:46:39.200]  Other than what the 8-Lit used to be, it used to do.
[00:46:39.200 --> 00:46:46.200]  I heard about the God Gardens.
[00:46:46.200 --> 00:46:56.200]  You know Mitho actually hated it every time he actually had people.
[00:46:56.200 --> 00:47:00.200]  What's your name?
[00:47:00.200 --> 00:47:05.200]  I'm sad it pauses.
[00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:09.200]  I've forgotten it.
[00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:38.200]  Give yourself a name. It can't be anything and I'll call you that. And Herdaias Mori will at least really care about that so it will be forever be known.
[00:47:38.200 --> 00:47:42.200]  I'm thinking of a name.
[00:47:42.200 --> 00:47:47.200]  I just want to let you know you missed the opportunity there to hit the "my name is Dea" soundboard.
[00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:51.200]  I don't have that one unfortunately. That is totally fair though.
[00:47:51.200 --> 00:48:10.200]  I go looking around and it's like...
[00:48:10.200 --> 00:48:32.200]  I guess my family usually named themselves after stars.
[00:48:32.200 --> 00:48:41.200]  I'm legitimately just giving you a second.
[00:48:41.200 --> 00:48:47.200]  I do ask him for one favor before we do anything.
[00:48:47.200 --> 00:48:57.200]  Can he at least fix up Mitho's body so I can transport it?
[00:48:57.200 --> 00:49:17.200]  You watch as one of the tendrils comes out from the spire, pierces his foot, and you watch as it pulses and you watch liquid as well as solid pieces moving into his foot.
[00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:21.200]  He's reconstructing the bones.
[00:49:21.200 --> 00:49:24.200]  I'll go vomit in the corner.
[00:49:24.200 --> 00:49:41.200]  I was about to make a vomit noise and then I remembered Maisie can't so I stopped myself.
[00:49:41.200 --> 00:50:01.200]  I bet I do go saying "if you want to bless me, best pains are sweet" so I go.
[00:50:01.200 --> 00:50:16.200]  I try to end you yourself. You can tell me the name later.
[00:50:16.200 --> 00:50:38.200]  Use it to find a way out for me and I can give it to you. While I might have experience and time, I can't leave here.
[00:50:38.200 --> 00:50:42.200]  Maybe there's something out there that can kill me.
[00:50:42.200 --> 00:50:49.200]  Do you want me to use Necrosis on the heart to try?
[00:50:49.200 --> 00:50:57.200]  I've tried it.
[00:50:57.200 --> 00:51:00.200]  You're not the first group down here.
[00:51:00.200 --> 00:51:06.200]  What about Aled?
[00:51:06.200 --> 00:51:16.200]  I have tried every manner of weaponry, every manner of spell. I've only shown you flesh taping.
[00:51:16.200 --> 00:51:24.200]  I was quite adept at most schools of magic.
[00:51:24.200 --> 00:51:32.200]  And when I wasn't, I've been able to learn and take from others.
[00:51:32.200 --> 00:51:35.200]  Why does it keep growing?
[00:51:35.200 --> 00:51:38.200]  Because it's people.
[00:51:38.200 --> 00:51:41.200]  Body, mass.
[00:51:41.200 --> 00:51:44.200]  Flesh magic can't make things.
[00:51:44.200 --> 00:51:50.200]  I was adding that if he's been down here for millennia, people don't come down here that often.
[00:51:50.200 --> 00:51:54.200]  He takes from the surface.
[00:51:54.200 --> 00:52:00.200]  He kidnaps people basically.
[00:52:00.200 --> 00:52:05.200]  People from up high, when they go into the prison, go missing mysteriously.
[00:52:05.200 --> 00:52:21.200]  No one comes down to the prison.
[00:52:21.200 --> 00:52:23.200]  This is sad, guys.
[00:52:23.200 --> 00:52:25.200]  Yes. Yes, it is.
[00:52:25.200 --> 00:52:30.200]  It's a bit of a mystery.
[00:52:30.200 --> 00:52:33.200]  It's pretty fucked up.
[00:52:33.200 --> 00:52:36.200]  But I will give you the knowledge.
[00:52:36.200 --> 00:52:47.200]  If you'll use it to find a way out for me.
[00:52:47.200 --> 00:52:58.200]  No one deserves to suffer this much.
[00:52:58.200 --> 00:53:13.200]  And you watch as more tendrils pull itself off of the spire, unwrapping itself, and to begin moving towards you.
[00:53:13.200 --> 00:53:22.200]  I do tend to flinch just a little bit because it's kind of gross, but I'm not moving away.
[00:53:22.200 --> 00:53:29.200]  You guys watch as these tendrils move and implant themselves into Vespera's temples.
[00:53:29.200 --> 00:53:36.200]  What about the broken skull that's in the back of my head? Because my skull is actually broken.
[00:53:36.200 --> 00:53:40.200]  He has a serious injury.
[00:53:40.200 --> 00:53:49.200]  As they make contact with you, it will begin rooting around, and it finds that and...
[00:53:49.200 --> 00:53:55.200]  into that open hole.
[00:53:55.200 --> 00:54:02.200]  Actually, you guys don't really see it too much because my hair is actually down.
[00:54:02.200 --> 00:54:06.200]  But I access.
[00:54:06.200 --> 00:54:11.200]  Make me an endurance check.
[00:54:11.200 --> 00:54:14.200]  Oh, this is gonna fucking suck.
[00:54:14.200 --> 00:54:17.200]  Endurance.
[00:54:17.200 --> 00:54:31.200]  Well, I'm gonna use the luck point.
[00:54:31.200 --> 00:54:35.200]  Yay! Oh, lucky number!
[00:54:35.200 --> 00:54:40.200]  Hey! Hooray!
[00:54:40.200 --> 00:54:42.200]  So, lucky...
[00:54:42.200 --> 00:54:44.200]  A lot of lucky numbers today.
[00:54:44.200 --> 00:54:45.200]  Right?
[00:54:45.200 --> 00:54:50.200]  When we need it the most.
[00:54:50.200 --> 00:54:54.200]  I repeat, on the ground.
[00:54:54.200 --> 00:54:57.200]  No, stop!
[00:54:57.200 --> 00:55:05.200]  It's incredibly painful. You can feel it rooting around in there.
[00:55:05.200 --> 00:55:16.200]  By the way, I'm gonna go templately blind because of this because it's the back of the head.
[00:55:16.200 --> 00:55:24.200]  You can see these moving, and you can see it writhing underneath her hair.
[00:55:24.200 --> 00:55:36.200]  And after about 10 seconds, it slowly pulls itself out, and you guys can hear the grinding of bones.
[00:55:36.200 --> 00:55:40.200]  No.
[00:55:40.200 --> 00:55:49.200]  And it pulls out and quickly comes back into the pillar.
[00:55:49.200 --> 00:55:51.200]  The sparrow.
[00:55:51.200 --> 00:55:55.200]  Go ahead and remove your lingering injury.
[00:55:55.200 --> 00:55:56.200]  Oh shit.
[00:55:56.200 --> 00:56:00.200]  As you feel back there and the bone is solid.
[00:56:00.200 --> 00:56:08.200]  Okay, what do I put down on foundry?
[00:56:08.200 --> 00:56:10.200]  Just remove the trait?
[00:56:10.200 --> 00:56:17.200]  Well, I know the trait also has a positive, so you would still keep the positive.
[00:56:17.200 --> 00:56:24.200]  Living with a painful injury has made the character tough, granting one stamina point.
[00:56:24.200 --> 00:56:26.200]  So that wouldn't go away.
[00:56:26.200 --> 00:56:29.200]  You're used to having this injury.
[00:56:29.200 --> 00:56:34.200]  It's just now gone.
[00:56:34.200 --> 00:56:36.200]  So, what is the other...
[00:56:36.200 --> 00:56:38.200]  So basically...
[00:56:38.200 --> 00:56:43.200]  At least on foundry, it doesn't currently have any negative effects on that.
[00:56:43.200 --> 00:56:49.200]  Well, it's one of those things where the GM player can work out a time where he's going to bug them.
[00:56:49.200 --> 00:56:51.200]  Yeah.
[00:56:51.200 --> 00:56:54.200]  So...
[00:56:54.200 --> 00:56:56.200]  So...
[00:56:56.200 --> 00:57:01.200]  I already put parentheses "healed."
[00:57:01.200 --> 00:57:05.200]  So we can know later on when we're going back.
[00:57:05.200 --> 00:57:10.200]  Yeah. So just leave it there until later.
[00:57:10.200 --> 00:57:15.200]  So again, you're going to keep the positive of it because you have had this injury for a while.
[00:57:15.200 --> 00:57:18.200]  But you won't have a negative.
[00:57:18.200 --> 00:57:27.200]  Got it. Basically, it will never be brought up.
[00:57:27.200 --> 00:57:31.200]  Your vision does go black for a second.
[00:57:31.200 --> 00:57:36.200]  But you feel back there and you feel that the bone is just solid.
[00:57:36.200 --> 00:57:38.200]  Yeah.
[00:57:38.200 --> 00:57:43.200]  I have enough knowledge there.
[00:57:43.200 --> 00:57:48.200]  It'll just be up to you to pursue it.
[00:57:48.200 --> 00:57:52.200]  You have a teacher. It's not going to be a thousand to get it. It's going to be 750.
[00:57:52.200 --> 00:57:56.200]  Or whatever the... I think it specifies you have a trainer.
[00:57:56.200 --> 00:57:57.200]  No.
[00:57:57.200 --> 00:57:59.200]  It's not going to be three.
[00:57:59.200 --> 00:58:01.200]  No.
[00:58:01.200 --> 00:58:06.200]  But it will... I think it says...
[00:58:06.200 --> 00:58:08.200]  We'll make it 750 for you.
[00:58:08.200 --> 00:58:10.200]  Yeah.
[00:58:10.200 --> 00:58:15.200]  Because a thousand if you're an A-Lid or being trained. Otherwise, 1500.
[00:58:15.200 --> 00:58:21.200]  Oh, I thought it was... Oh, okay.
[00:58:21.200 --> 00:58:23.200]  So when we expensive, this is going to be reduced.
[00:58:23.200 --> 00:58:27.200]  Okay.
[00:58:27.200 --> 00:58:34.200]  I'm going to have to keep track of pain points now.
[00:58:34.200 --> 00:58:38.200]  Yeah, unless you're able to spend 750.
[00:58:38.200 --> 00:58:43.200]  I... after this session, because I got 10 points missing.
[00:58:43.200 --> 00:58:45.200]  Ah, okay.
[00:58:45.200 --> 00:58:49.200]  Fine.
[00:58:49.200 --> 00:58:50.200]  Sorry.
[00:58:50.200 --> 00:58:55.200]  God, I love pain sorcery, but it is a bastard to track those.
[00:58:55.200 --> 00:58:56.200]  Yep.
[00:58:56.200 --> 00:59:03.200]  They also balance it more. You can only hold a number of pain points equal to half of your endurance score.
[00:59:03.200 --> 00:59:06.200]  Weirdo-less bonus.
[00:59:06.200 --> 00:59:08.200]  Oh wait, let me double-track that.
[00:59:08.200 --> 00:59:09.200]  Yeah.
[00:59:09.200 --> 00:59:12.200]  They nerfed it. I know they... or they did something with it.
[00:59:12.200 --> 00:59:18.200]  God, you are covered in Dorito dust.
[00:59:18.200 --> 00:59:20.200]  Just hearing that...
[00:59:20.200 --> 00:59:28.200]  Uh...
[00:59:28.200 --> 00:59:34.200]  I'm going to ask if you can clear the target or targets and test the number of pain points. Where does it say...
[00:59:34.200 --> 00:59:36.200]  Oh, my bad.
[00:59:36.200 --> 00:59:38.200]  Oh, okay. That's a lot better than I thought it was.
[00:59:38.200 --> 00:59:43.200]  The Flesh Shaper can store a number of pain points equal to half their willpower score.
[00:59:43.200 --> 00:59:45.200]  Oh, so 25 for me.
[00:59:45.200 --> 00:59:46.200]  Yep.
[00:59:46.200 --> 00:59:47.200]  Okay.
[00:59:47.200 --> 00:59:48.200]  That's quite a lot.
[00:59:48.200 --> 00:59:49.200]  That's quite a lot.
[00:59:49.200 --> 00:59:50.200]  Yeah.
[00:59:50.200 --> 00:59:53.200]  All points are lost, however, at the end of a long rest.
[00:59:53.200 --> 01:00:02.200]  Yeah. But whenever I see great horrors, fear, pain, and I don't even have to be the one hurting people.
[01:00:02.200 --> 01:00:06.200]  Nope. If someone sustains a wound around you.
[01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:08.200]  Yep. And I'll keep that track.
[01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:11.200]  When you're in combat, you're probably getting a pain point.
[01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:12.200]  Oh, I'm getting several.
[01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:16.200]  I'm good at doing wounds with my sneak attacks.
[01:00:16.200 --> 01:00:17.200]  Yeah.
[01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:20.200]  As long as I see it. I had to see it.
[01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:21.200]  Yep.
[01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:26.200]  So I'd be keeping that track off to the side with the Peace Paper, by the way.
[01:00:26.200 --> 01:00:31.200]  That's fun. Yeah, because it's gonna go away at the end of every day anyway. But it's good to keep track of it.
[01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:35.200]  I'm not using it in this session, so I don't have it prepared.
[01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:36.200]  Okay.
[01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:49.200]  All right. So you all watch these tentacles whip out of Vespero's head, and she kind of stumbles a little bit in place before coming to.
[01:00:51.200 --> 01:01:04.200]  Okay.
[01:01:04.200 --> 01:01:12.200]  How do we get out of here? And I'm taking his body with me.
[01:01:12.200 --> 01:01:21.200]  Looking at me, though.
[01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:29.200]  There is a exit that leads out underneath the city.
[01:01:29.200 --> 01:01:34.200]  Another individual who came to visit me took it to get out.
[01:01:34.200 --> 01:01:37.200]  I wonder who that could be.
[01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:39.200]  I think we met him.
[01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:42.200]  No, he flew out.
[01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:44.200]  No, he did not.
[01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:46.200]  Oh.
[01:01:46.200 --> 01:01:48.200]  Because his friend could not fly.
[01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:55.200]  Oh, I thought he took his fin and flew. My bad.
[01:01:55.200 --> 01:01:56.200]  Okay.
[01:01:56.200 --> 01:02:06.200]  There is a doorway behind the spire.
[01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:17.200]  I look at the flesh and go insane.
[01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:21.200]  I will come back.
[01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:24.200]  Look forward to it.
[01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:32.200]  At least you can finally rest after this.
[01:02:32.200 --> 01:02:37.200]  And I ask Holda.
[01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:43.200]  And I go saying, like, can you take me, though?
[01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:46.200]  Of course.
[01:02:46.200 --> 01:02:50.200]  He'll very, you know, gingerly pick him up.
[01:02:50.200 --> 01:02:54.200]  He's actually full on non-jelly anymore.
[01:02:54.200 --> 01:03:06.200]  With respect and plainness, not just like sack of potatoes.
[01:03:06.200 --> 01:03:09.200]  He weighs about as much as a sack of potatoes.
[01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:15.200]  I have paper towels and water.
[01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:20.200]  Well, I have another like 1500 I can carry before I'm even lightly loaded.
[01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:26.200]  He weighs probably like about 200 with his height.
[01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:33.200]  I won't even be lightly encumbered.
[01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:38.200]  I mean, it's going to be awkward. It's not like I can fight, you know, like this.
[01:03:38.200 --> 01:03:44.200]  But, you know.
[01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:54.200]  If he's so damn carrying for such a long distance through the winding sewers, am I going to need to do like an endurance or something just to carry him the whole time?
[01:03:54.200 --> 01:04:00.200]  With a 60 strength?
[01:04:00.200 --> 01:04:04.200]  I do take that dagger, though, and put it on me.
[01:04:04.200 --> 01:04:09.200]  I'm going to let my hair be down. It's like tailbone length, by the way.
[01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:11.200]  Oh, he has long hair.
[01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:12.200]  Yes.
[01:04:12.200 --> 01:04:14.200]  I wish my hair was that long.
[01:04:14.200 --> 01:04:17.200]  I had longer hair.
[01:04:17.200 --> 01:04:24.200]  I did have longer hair. I think you guys remember it, like, before I cut it off.
[01:04:24.200 --> 01:04:29.200]  Like, part of me wants hair that long and the other part of me does not want to maintain hair.
[01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:32.200]  It was hell just maintaining it, okay?
[01:04:32.200 --> 01:04:33.200]  Like.
[01:04:33.200 --> 01:04:37.200]  Imagine.
[01:04:37.200 --> 01:04:38.200]  Gavin, you're good?
[01:04:38.200 --> 01:04:40.200]  Mine's like shoulder length right now.
[01:04:40.200 --> 01:04:41.200]  Oh, yeah.
[01:04:41.200 --> 01:04:49.200]  I'm just keeping my mind occupied so I don't jump in and, you know, because I'm not there.
[01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:52.200]  Yeah, by the way, you keep on cutting in and out.
[01:04:52.200 --> 01:04:57.200]  I know. It's because the computer's processing Ultrakill.
[01:04:57.200 --> 01:05:00.200]  Because I'm playing Ultrakill to keep myself distracted.
[01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:02.200]  Okay, got it.
[01:05:02.200 --> 01:05:06.200]  I mean, Gavin, he is here. He just.
[01:05:06.200 --> 01:05:09.200]  It's not like he's capable of hearing everybody.
[01:05:09.200 --> 01:05:13.200]  No.
[01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:16.200]  Yes, it was okay.
[01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:20.200]  I could have changed her, babe. I didn't know that's what you needed.
[01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:22.200]  She got into the floor and changed Maddie.
[01:05:22.200 --> 01:05:24.200]  Oh.
[01:05:24.200 --> 01:05:27.200]  I didn't know what she was doing until she was on the floor.
[01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:29.200]  I could have done that.
[01:05:29.200 --> 01:05:32.200]  I had gone to you and I was like, what happened?
[01:05:32.200 --> 01:05:36.200]  By the way, so both babies are like this.
[01:05:36.200 --> 01:05:37.200]  Mm hmm.
[01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:41.200]  Stacked underneath her ribs.
[01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:45.200]  So whenever she bends down.
[01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:51.200]  I can't breathe.
[01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:57.200]  I have never been pregnant, so I don't understand the pain.
[01:05:57.200 --> 01:06:04.200]  There's a reason why you can get temporary disability sicker, because you are disabled when you're pregnant.
[01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:06.200]  Disabled when you're pregnant.
[01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:08.200]  Yes, 100 percent.
[01:06:08.200 --> 01:06:10.200]  Yeah.
[01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:19.200]  I'm trying to put the form off for now. I'm also trying to do it for myself because I'm usually good most days, but then there are those days that I need a cane to walk.
[01:06:19.200 --> 01:06:21.200]  Mm hmm.
[01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:23.200]  They don't have a dog in butt.
[01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:25.200]  Yeah.
[01:06:25.200 --> 01:06:27.200]  To the point where I've.
[01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:29.200]  I almost had to call 911 for my disk.
[01:06:29.200 --> 01:06:31.200]  You're not.
[01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:35.200]  I couldn't get off the ground. I was lying down for like two hours. I couldn't get up.
[01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:37.200]  Oh my God.
[01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:43.200]  I was like, I was like getting ready to and I finally get myself, you know, sitting upright and went from there.
[01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:45.200]  Jesus.
[01:06:45.200 --> 01:06:46.200]  Yeah.
[01:06:46.200 --> 01:06:51.200]  No to self, no playing kickball ever again.
[01:06:51.200 --> 01:06:52.200]  Yeah.
[01:06:52.200 --> 01:06:57.200]  I, you know, I'm very competitive, so I can't like casually play a sport.
[01:06:57.200 --> 01:06:58.200]  Mm hmm.
[01:06:58.200 --> 01:07:03.200]  And my body is, my spine is all are capable of like heavy activities.
[01:07:03.200 --> 01:07:09.200]  That's why my hobbies are shooting now because that's not very high activity.
[01:07:09.200 --> 01:07:11.200]  Yeah.
[01:07:11.200 --> 01:07:15.200]  Um, what was I gonna say?
[01:07:15.200 --> 01:07:20.200]  Um, but you guys find your way.
[01:07:20.200 --> 01:07:22.200]  I'm not going to make rolls for this.
[01:07:22.200 --> 01:07:36.200]  You guys are able to find your way through the sewer system underneath the watch to eventually come to a great that is open on the outside.
[01:07:36.200 --> 01:07:38.200]  Most of the.
[01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:45.200]  There doesn't seem to be much liquid down here because where the water was flowing a there's nothing flowing anymore.
[01:07:45.200 --> 01:08:01.200]  It's gone empty seconds there's rock covering everything so it's fairly clean. You just gotta watch your step a little bit.
[01:08:01.200 --> 01:08:05.200]  But you guys come out where it was flowing.
[01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:07.200]  Yeah, that's not that's not too hard.
[01:08:07.200 --> 01:08:13.200]  You guys finally make your way out of the city.
[01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:20.200]  Sarah, did you want to do you have a spot you wanted to bury me toe or.
[01:08:20.200 --> 01:08:23.200]  Gavin.
[01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:25.200]  It's home.
[01:08:25.200 --> 01:08:27.200]  By the way, old tower.
[01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:30.200]  You would have told Mike Everett right.
[01:08:30.200 --> 01:08:31.200]  Yes.
[01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:35.200]  Okay, I just was wanting to make that clear.
[01:08:35.200 --> 01:08:37.200]  Gavin.
[01:08:37.200 --> 01:08:45.200]  Just so you know, I'm.
[01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:47.200]  Did you see my message.
[01:08:47.200 --> 01:08:50.200]  I did very similar to how I was thinking.
[01:08:50.200 --> 01:08:52.200]  Yeah, that's like the best.
[01:08:52.200 --> 01:08:57.200]  That thing is the closest thing you can get to that.
[01:08:57.200 --> 01:09:00.200]  I haven't played much the Witcher game, so I just didn't know what you're talking about.
[01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:08.200]  Wrong, but.
[01:09:08.200 --> 01:09:12.200]  You help up.
[01:09:12.200 --> 01:09:19.200]  Will you let me try to help you up.
[01:09:19.200 --> 01:09:23.200]  Okay.
[01:09:23.200 --> 01:09:25.200]  Right.
[01:09:25.200 --> 01:09:30.200]  Huh.
[01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:39.200]  Come here.
[01:09:39.200 --> 01:09:42.200]  This is where your favorite movies.
[01:09:42.200 --> 01:09:45.200]  Yeah.
[01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:48.200]  Watching Coco, she loves it.
[01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:49.200]  Wait, which movie.
[01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:52.200]  Coco's talking fantastic.
[01:09:52.200 --> 01:09:55.200]  That movie makes me cry every time.
[01:09:55.200 --> 01:09:56.200]  Oh yeah.
[01:09:56.200 --> 01:10:04.200]  When the when the like the song that the dad would sing to the daughter comes on like it hits completely different now.
[01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:06.200]  Which movie.
[01:10:06.200 --> 01:10:07.200]  Coco Coco.
[01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:09.200]  Never seen me.
[01:10:09.200 --> 01:10:14.200]  It's about a kiss about a kid who goes to the land of the dead and.
[01:10:14.200 --> 01:10:17.200]  It probably there's really.
[01:10:17.200 --> 01:10:27.200]  There's a song that he that is played in it where it's it's originally meant to be from a father who was a little bit always be away singing to his song.
[01:10:27.200 --> 01:10:30.200]  It was a special song you would sing for her.
[01:10:30.200 --> 01:10:31.200]  Oh, I'd lose it.
[01:10:31.200 --> 01:10:32.200]  I would lose it.
[01:10:32.200 --> 01:10:33.200]  So.
[01:10:33.200 --> 01:10:36.200]  Oh, the really fucked up thing is.
[01:10:36.200 --> 01:10:40.200]  If you never wind up or plan on watching it.
[01:10:40.200 --> 01:10:54.200]  The dad or the dad of the daughter was poisoned by the person who he was working with because he they sang together and he wanted to go out and get out and go be with his family.
[01:10:54.200 --> 01:11:00.200]  But he poisoned him and stole his notebook and started singing his songs as his own and they got really famous.
[01:11:00.200 --> 01:11:01.200]  And his guitar.
[01:11:01.200 --> 01:11:02.200]  And his guitar.
[01:11:02.200 --> 01:11:04.200]  On top of that just.
[01:11:04.200 --> 01:11:13.200]  And the whole thing is he is in the day he is in the land of the dead dying because as far as the family was concerned.
[01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:15.200]  He just fucking left.
[01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:17.200]  He never came back.
[01:11:17.200 --> 01:11:21.200]  So they ripped his picture up and never displayed on the ofrenda.
[01:11:21.200 --> 01:11:24.200]  Therefore, he could never come and visit them during the day of the dead.
[01:11:24.200 --> 01:11:25.200]  And.
[01:11:25.200 --> 01:11:27.200]  He was being forgotten.
[01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:34.200]  The last person who could who could remember him was his daughter who was about to die because she's dying of old age.
[01:11:34.200 --> 01:11:35.200]  Yeah.
[01:11:35.200 --> 01:11:43.200]  And the main character gets back to the land of living and rejogs her memory.
[01:11:43.200 --> 01:11:45.200]  By playing the song.
[01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:47.200]  And they finally put the picture up.
[01:11:47.200 --> 01:11:52.200]  So because the thing is, as soon as no one remembers him, he can never go visit her.
[01:11:52.200 --> 01:11:54.200]  But all he wants to do is see his daughter again.
[01:11:54.200 --> 01:12:00.200]  But the second she dies, the last person who knows about him is gone.
[01:12:00.200 --> 01:12:01.200]  And he'll.
[01:12:01.200 --> 01:12:04.200]  Fade into existence.
[01:12:04.200 --> 01:12:06.200]  So he'll still never see her when she dies.
[01:12:06.200 --> 01:12:07.200]  Yeah.
[01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:08.200]  It's so sad.
[01:12:08.200 --> 01:12:11.200]  But it's it's it's a really good movie.
[01:12:11.200 --> 01:12:13.200]  But that song gets me crying every time.
[01:12:13.200 --> 01:12:15.200]  It's a tearjerker.
[01:12:15.200 --> 01:12:21.200]  The only bad thing is the guy who stole.
[01:12:21.200 --> 01:12:30.200]  The guy who stole his music will still live on forever to be known as the evil man that stole the music.
[01:12:30.200 --> 01:12:32.200]  So everybody remembers him.
[01:12:32.200 --> 01:12:35.200]  He still exists.
[01:12:35.200 --> 01:12:36.200]  Yeah.
[01:12:36.200 --> 01:12:37.200]  Yeah.
[01:12:37.200 --> 01:12:39.200]  And in the afterlife, he gets punished for it.
[01:12:39.200 --> 01:12:40.200]  So yeah.
[01:12:40.200 --> 01:12:41.200]  Yeah.
[01:12:41.200 --> 01:12:42.200]  Then we're just good.
[01:12:42.200 --> 01:12:45.200]  So he gets to sit in the afterlife.
[01:12:45.200 --> 01:12:46.200]  And yeah.
[01:12:46.200 --> 01:12:47.200]  Punishment.
[01:12:47.200 --> 01:12:48.200]  Yep.
[01:12:48.200 --> 01:12:59.200]  Yeah. Anyway, you guys get out of the sewers of the city of Kvatch and.
[01:12:59.200 --> 01:13:04.200]  He said his his he would want to be buried home.
[01:13:04.200 --> 01:13:08.200]  Going to the bike gold tower.
[01:13:08.200 --> 01:13:11.200]  OK.
[01:13:11.200 --> 01:13:16.200]  I replied back, by the way, to this point.
[01:13:16.200 --> 01:13:32.200]  I'm I do try to look for bandages or any other cloth and and even use my own like.
[01:13:32.200 --> 01:13:45.200]  Some of the cloth that I actually actually use my Thelmore agent cloak and start wrapping him up as best as I can.
[01:13:45.200 --> 01:13:49.200]  At least from the head chest.
[01:13:49.200 --> 01:13:57.200]  Because, you know, on another day, you kind of covered the face.
[01:13:57.200 --> 01:14:03.200]  Yeah, you might guess you bandage of any open wounds.
[01:14:03.200 --> 01:14:11.200]  Covers face and you're going to bandage him from head to chest.
[01:14:11.200 --> 01:14:14.200]  I don't really have too much clothes.
[01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:19.200]  Oh, wait, I got I do got that bed full of them.
[01:14:19.200 --> 01:14:20.200]  Yeah, this stuff.
[01:14:20.200 --> 01:14:25.200]  Yeah, I can stuff him in that.
[01:14:25.200 --> 01:14:28.200]  This is really sad, guys.
[01:14:28.200 --> 01:14:31.200]  Right in there.
[01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:34.200]  It doesn't bother me.
[01:14:34.200 --> 01:14:37.200]  Yeah, spring.
[01:14:37.200 --> 01:14:39.200]  Can we get a cart?
[01:14:39.200 --> 01:14:42.200]  You guys have a cart.
[01:14:42.200 --> 01:14:44.200]  But putting him in the cart.
[01:14:44.200 --> 01:14:49.200]  Yeah, I can carry him for three days, but I don't want to carry him.
[01:14:49.200 --> 01:14:52.200]  Yep.
[01:14:52.200 --> 01:15:01.200]  OK, so you put in the cart and you take the bedroll that he had and drape it over him.
[01:15:01.200 --> 01:15:03.200]  I think he actually had a blanket.
[01:15:03.200 --> 01:15:05.200]  Yeah, you take his blanket and drape it over him.
[01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:06.200]  Yeah.
[01:15:06.200 --> 01:15:10.200]  And.
[01:15:10.200 --> 01:15:12.200]  And I do take his.
[01:15:12.200 --> 01:15:25.200]  Oh, wait, I do have I am taking his possession and it will be the thieves at the tortures and torture tools.
[01:15:25.200 --> 01:15:35.200]  You guys start heading back towards Imperial City about a half day into the trip.
[01:15:35.200 --> 01:15:40.200]  You just see a cat walking along the road.
[01:15:40.200 --> 01:15:42.200]  Rob.
[01:15:42.200 --> 01:15:45.200]  Doesn't respond.
[01:15:45.200 --> 01:15:47.200]  To send you.
[01:15:47.200 --> 01:15:49.200]  You can't hear or see you.
[01:15:49.200 --> 01:15:51.200]  I'm muted, apparently.
[01:15:51.200 --> 01:15:55.200]  Oh, no, he's deaf and blind.
[01:15:55.200 --> 01:15:57.200]  Oh, God, that's a horrible existence.
[01:15:57.200 --> 01:15:59.200]  Actually, he's not blind.
[01:15:59.200 --> 01:16:05.200]  Yeah, he'll he'll look over and notice he's stumbling a little bit.
[01:16:05.200 --> 01:16:12.200]  You can still see some of the blood on the cheeks where his eyes were bleeding.
[01:16:12.200 --> 01:16:25.200]  So I think it picked up my whole whether he wants to or not and get cleaned up because she's incapable of not seeing him in the house.
[01:16:25.200 --> 01:16:29.200]  Very good.
[01:16:29.200 --> 01:16:30.200]  Where where is it?
[01:16:30.200 --> 01:16:33.200]  Where is it?
[01:16:33.200 --> 01:16:34.200]  I need to find it.
[01:16:34.200 --> 01:16:37.200]  This.
[01:16:37.200 --> 01:16:44.200]  I just know you have the guess what the fuck is up with the give this.
[01:16:44.200 --> 01:16:45.200]  Why you put out.
[01:16:45.200 --> 01:16:46.200]  Yeah.
[01:16:46.200 --> 01:16:50.200]  And there's the gift of how much that skin.
[01:16:50.200 --> 01:16:58.200]  You guys are talking about fun.
[01:16:58.200 --> 01:17:08.200]  But he'll he'll get kind of like cleaned up a little bit and to send it will be like leave the center alone center center is fine.
[01:17:08.200 --> 01:17:15.200]  Although you can definitely tell by his tail that he's more happy with it than he lets on.
[01:17:15.200 --> 01:17:20.200]  That's the center. You're not fine. Like, you know, what's going to be here?
[01:17:20.200 --> 01:17:22.200]  What happened to you?
[01:17:22.200 --> 01:17:27.200]  Send the complete task.
[01:17:27.200 --> 01:17:29.200]  God, spirit, or more.
[01:17:29.200 --> 01:17:31.200]  Gave.
[01:17:31.200 --> 01:17:34.200]  Oh, did you find your school thing?
[01:17:34.200 --> 01:17:43.200]  He'll kind of reach back with the into his bag and kind of pull out an elder school in front of everyone.
[01:17:43.200 --> 01:17:51.200]  My character is looked over at you and just look straight ahead with a thousand.
[01:17:51.200 --> 01:17:52.200]  I stare.
[01:17:52.200 --> 01:17:54.200]  Thousand yards there.
[01:17:54.200 --> 01:17:55.200]  Yes. Thank you.
[01:17:55.200 --> 01:17:58.200]  I like grab the older school.
[01:17:58.200 --> 01:18:01.200]  They're big, aren't they?
[01:18:01.200 --> 01:18:02.200]  They're very large.
[01:18:02.200 --> 01:18:05.200]  They're like this big.
[01:18:05.200 --> 01:18:07.200]  Yeah, I know.
[01:18:07.200 --> 01:18:14.200]  Send her. Send her has wet bag.
[01:18:14.200 --> 01:18:23.200]  Send her out. Put in wet bag and attached to backpack.
[01:18:23.200 --> 01:18:25.200]  The waterproof bag.
[01:18:25.200 --> 01:18:28.200]  Okay, kind of like a school bag.
[01:18:28.200 --> 01:18:29.200]  Yeah.
[01:18:29.200 --> 01:18:30.200]  Okay.
[01:18:30.200 --> 01:18:32.200]  No idea what you mean by wet bag.
[01:18:32.200 --> 01:18:37.200]  I know.
[01:18:37.200 --> 01:18:38.200]  I go.
[01:18:38.200 --> 01:18:45.200]  It will actually Mike, I would do won't be saying much right now.
[01:18:45.200 --> 01:18:49.200]  Send her. I have some bad news.
[01:18:49.200 --> 01:18:52.200]  What kind of check the cart.
[01:18:52.200 --> 01:19:00.200]  What is what is bad news to send her see all the friends here, but you're missing one.
[01:19:00.200 --> 01:19:03.200]  Me, so it's not me. So it's not sleeping.
[01:19:03.200 --> 01:19:06.200]  Yeah.
[01:19:06.200 --> 01:19:14.200]  He'll kind of hesitate a bit at that.
[01:19:14.200 --> 01:19:25.200]  And the center will quickly get out of hold his arms and go over to the cart.
[01:19:25.200 --> 01:19:30.200]  Oh, no, it's he's no.
[01:19:30.200 --> 01:19:41.200]  And he'll start to kind of like use his claws a little bit to get a little bit of purchase and kind of move the federal out of the way.
[01:19:41.200 --> 01:19:44.200]  Kind of looking at him.
[01:19:44.200 --> 01:19:46.200]  This is a good one.
[01:19:46.200 --> 01:19:55.200]  And looks kind of he just stares at it for a little while.
[01:19:55.200 --> 01:20:00.200]  I've been really a little bit.
[01:20:00.200 --> 01:20:04.200]  And there's no words that goes in anybody's heads.
[01:20:04.200 --> 01:20:11.200]  There's just that that cats yell.
[01:20:11.200 --> 01:20:17.200]  That you end up hearing and this is.
[01:20:17.200 --> 01:20:23.200]  This book will go over and my shoulder.
[01:20:23.200 --> 01:20:39.200]  Oh, actually, as a support character, as a support animal, this was going to take him and hold him and just silently cries.
[01:20:39.200 --> 01:20:44.200]  Because you know how some people wait until somebody else cries.
[01:20:44.200 --> 01:20:46.200]  Yeah. And then let's go. Yeah.
[01:20:46.200 --> 01:20:52.200]  Although it kind of just kind of the shoulder, you know, yeah, I'm learning something right now.
[01:20:52.200 --> 01:20:54.200]  I'll be right back. Yeah.
[01:20:54.200 --> 01:21:02.200]  And kneeling down and just crying my fucking eyes out with with the cat.
[01:21:02.200 --> 01:21:15.200]  Finding more cat gifts.
[01:21:15.200 --> 01:21:22.200]  You like the one I found? I've never found a gift of a cat going.
[01:21:22.200 --> 01:21:24.200]  Yeah, here we go. Here we go.
[01:21:24.200 --> 01:21:28.200]  I got this. I got this dog.
[01:21:28.200 --> 01:21:33.200]  It's just that.
[01:21:33.200 --> 01:21:36.200]  Oh, yeah.
[01:21:36.200 --> 01:21:38.200]  I'm waiting for it to load.
[01:21:38.200 --> 01:21:41.200]  Oh, I found one.
[01:21:41.200 --> 01:21:45.200]  Oh, that rocket.
[01:21:45.200 --> 01:21:49.200]  That it's just that.
[01:21:49.200 --> 01:21:53.200]  It's in general.
[01:21:53.200 --> 01:21:58.200]  That general. That's all I got. Yeah. I don't know what you're talking about.
[01:21:58.200 --> 01:22:02.200]  There's one called Alphic Gifts.
[01:22:02.200 --> 01:22:05.200]  Yeah, I don't see that.
[01:22:05.200 --> 01:22:08.200]  Fucking weird. It's just below category art.
[01:22:08.200 --> 01:22:11.200]  About session summaries.
[01:22:11.200 --> 01:22:14.200]  I don't have session summaries either.
[01:22:14.200 --> 01:22:18.200]  Why don't you have all these things? Yeah, I don't know.
[01:22:18.200 --> 01:22:23.200]  Discord must hate you. I don't know what's going on. Why don't you love me, Tim?
[01:22:23.200 --> 01:22:26.200]  Have you have you been missing the Alphic Gifts this whole time?
[01:22:26.200 --> 01:22:31.200]  I guess. That's why I keep putting stuff in general, because that's all that I fucking have.
[01:22:31.200 --> 01:22:37.200]  Oh, that's so sad. I have so many things in the Alphic Gifts.
[01:22:37.200 --> 01:22:42.200]  I started sending so many Alphic Gifts.
[01:22:42.200 --> 01:22:45.200]  We can figure it out later. I just.
[01:22:45.200 --> 01:22:48.200]  That's frustrating. Yes, it is.
[01:22:48.200 --> 01:22:51.200]  What are you all talking about? Where?
[01:22:51.200 --> 01:22:57.200]  Oh, by the way, Trevor, the set looked good for how it was, but my head was where I can't produce.
[01:22:57.200 --> 01:23:00.200]  Scheduling, general, character art.
[01:23:00.200 --> 01:23:05.200]  Boy? Yeah.
[01:23:05.200 --> 01:23:09.200]  That's it. The cat.
[01:23:09.200 --> 01:23:15.200]  I'm sorry, I need to go hunt my dog. Right.
[01:23:15.200 --> 01:23:18.200]  Oh.
[01:23:18.200 --> 01:23:22.200]  All that I did was I hit show all chats.
[01:23:22.200 --> 01:23:27.200]  Oh, yeah, that'll do it. Yeah. Discord changed it where you can hide certain chats to never show up.
[01:23:27.200 --> 01:23:33.200]  Why? And they defaulted some chats to be hidden because there are some servers like gaming servers
[01:23:33.200 --> 01:23:42.200]  for, say, like the Helldiver server where you might not want to see the 40 plus voice chats that they have.
[01:23:42.200 --> 01:23:45.200]  So you disable those so they don't pop up.
[01:23:45.200 --> 01:23:49.200]  Well, that's fine. But why did I get rid of the ones that I wanted?
[01:23:49.200 --> 01:23:57.200]  I don't know. It doesn't know what you want unless you tell it. You want all these channels.
[01:23:57.200 --> 01:24:04.200]  I am behind by like a week or so. So I'm catching up.
[01:24:04.200 --> 01:24:07.200]  OK. You're great. Enjoy them.
[01:24:07.200 --> 01:24:10.200]  Yeah. OK. Yeah.
[01:24:10.200 --> 01:24:14.200]  This is just him. So I might as well. It's not a cat, but it's close enough.
[01:24:14.200 --> 01:24:22.200]  I see the blue eyes now. OK.
[01:24:22.200 --> 01:24:36.200]  They are free.
[01:24:36.200 --> 01:24:41.200]  I want to go back to beach.
[01:24:41.200 --> 01:24:53.200]  OK. Sorry about that.
[01:24:53.200 --> 01:24:59.200]  No, it's all good. At least you see all of my alfique gifts that I give for the entire session now.
[01:24:59.200 --> 01:25:03.200]  I appreciate it because I was like, what are you all talking about? I was so confused.
[01:25:03.200 --> 01:25:06.200]  Yeah. So.
[01:25:06.200 --> 01:25:12.200]  What's up, Sue? So was that the last time?
[01:25:12.200 --> 01:25:17.200]  Well, you did. But I thought I fixed it and I guess I hadn't.
[01:25:17.200 --> 01:25:20.200]  That was my bad.
[01:25:20.200 --> 01:25:28.200]  By the way, Cole, you are seeing Whisper and Tessandra crying.
[01:25:28.200 --> 01:25:36.200]  Holda had to run off, not really good with high emotions. Don't know what Benny is doing.
[01:25:36.200 --> 01:25:46.200]  And we got you watching all this.
[01:25:46.200 --> 01:25:48.200]  I'm trying to think of what I would do.
[01:25:48.200 --> 01:25:53.200]  Oh, in your naivety, have you dealt with people dying before?
[01:25:53.200 --> 01:25:55.200]  I don't know.
[01:25:55.200 --> 01:26:02.200]  She could just be fucking emotionless and just.
[01:26:02.200 --> 01:26:09.200]  It's not going to hit for like two weeks and then you'll finally realize, oh, shit, he's not coming back.
[01:26:09.200 --> 01:26:15.200]  I know what Celeste would do. I'm tempted to just do that.
[01:26:15.200 --> 01:26:22.200]  Can I go over and just kind of like pat Whisper and Tessandra on the head?
[01:26:22.200 --> 01:26:25.200]  Yeah, it might. I don't know what else to do. Just like.
[01:26:25.200 --> 01:26:29.200]  It might make us cry harder, but it helps.
[01:26:29.200 --> 01:26:33.200]  Let you know I'm there. I'm here. I don't.
[01:26:33.200 --> 01:26:38.200]  It's very obvious that Coral does not know what's going on in this situation, but she's trying her best.
[01:26:38.200 --> 01:26:42.200]  And Benny is just staying away.
[01:26:42.200 --> 01:26:44.200]  Actually, how is Benny doing?
[01:26:44.200 --> 01:26:51.200]  Yeah, he just watched something horrific.
[01:26:51.200 --> 01:26:52.200]  Forget you.
[01:26:52.200 --> 01:26:55.200]  You wasn't prepared for Benny's emotions?
[01:26:55.200 --> 01:27:00.200]  No, I was not.
[01:27:00.200 --> 01:27:07.200]  He's our mascot. You should expect us to have stupid things with them.
[01:27:07.200 --> 01:27:10.200]  Oh shit, he is our mascot.
[01:27:10.200 --> 01:27:13.200]  He is. We adopted him.
[01:27:13.200 --> 01:27:17.200]  You notice you don't see him.
[01:27:17.200 --> 01:27:18.200]  Can I make an information check?
[01:27:18.200 --> 01:27:20.200]  Benny is gone.
[01:27:20.200 --> 01:27:25.200]  He is. He has not left the cart.
[01:27:25.200 --> 01:27:30.200]  He's in the cart with me, though.
[01:27:30.200 --> 01:27:34.200]  Is he alive?
[01:27:34.200 --> 01:27:35.200]  Well, no.
[01:27:35.200 --> 01:27:39.200]  Neither of them are.
[01:27:39.200 --> 01:27:41.200]  To be fair.
[01:27:41.200 --> 01:27:44.200]  Is he alive? No, no, neither.
[01:27:44.200 --> 01:27:50.200]  He's just kind of sitting there, knees to his chest, hugging his legs.
[01:27:50.200 --> 01:27:55.200]  Benny, are you okay?
[01:27:55.200 --> 01:28:00.200]  I probably have a flask of something alcohol to pick up for him.
[01:28:00.200 --> 01:28:08.200]  He'll take the drink and take a good sip.
[01:28:08.200 --> 01:28:22.200]  Just...
[01:28:22.200 --> 01:28:23.200]  Yeah, it was a lot.
[01:28:23.200 --> 01:28:25.200]  Yeah.
[01:28:25.200 --> 01:28:28.200]  I don't think that was something people are meant to see.
[01:28:28.200 --> 01:28:33.200]  No.
[01:28:33.200 --> 01:28:38.200]  I've seen plenty of bloody things, but not that.
[01:28:38.200 --> 01:28:39.200]  You threw up?
[01:28:39.200 --> 01:28:44.200]  I...
[01:28:44.200 --> 01:28:50.200]  Not right. It doesn't feel right.
[01:28:50.200 --> 01:28:59.200]  It's not what it is. What happened?
[01:28:59.200 --> 01:29:01.200]  My back. Ow.
[01:29:01.200 --> 01:29:08.200]  I'll watch over his body until we get there.
[01:29:08.200 --> 01:29:12.200]  Thank you.
[01:29:12.200 --> 01:29:16.200]  And he doesn't have to leave?
[01:29:16.200 --> 01:29:18.200]  He can just sit there.
[01:29:18.200 --> 01:29:21.200]  He will pass you by, for flask.
[01:29:21.200 --> 01:29:24.200]  Probably more empty than people wanted, but you know.
[01:29:24.200 --> 01:29:26.200]  That half of it's gone.
[01:29:26.200 --> 01:29:31.200]  About half of it left at this point.
[01:29:31.200 --> 01:29:36.200]  Okay. I'll help refill it when we get back to the city.
[01:29:36.200 --> 01:29:38.200]  I got a good gift.
[01:29:38.200 --> 01:29:42.200]  At the F-beak. Trevor, look at the F-beak.
[01:29:42.200 --> 01:29:43.200]  What do you have?
[01:29:43.200 --> 01:29:55.200]  Tell Benny, don't worry about it, Benny. Either way, it was going to be empty by the end of today.
[01:29:55.200 --> 01:30:05.200]  We love you, Maddie. Maddie, can I have a hug?
[01:30:05.200 --> 01:30:10.200]  I was looking at the pain sorcerer because I'm creating my backup character.
[01:30:10.200 --> 01:30:13.200]  And it is a thousand if you are an a-liter trained.
[01:30:13.200 --> 01:30:15.200]  Not 750. Just so you know.
[01:30:15.200 --> 01:30:17.200]  Oh.
[01:30:17.200 --> 01:30:19.200]  He's reduced.
[01:30:19.200 --> 01:30:26.200]  I'm reduced this further because she is getting taught by this thing.
[01:30:26.200 --> 01:30:28.200]  I can't free you.
[01:30:28.200 --> 01:30:30.200]  It's injected into your brain.
[01:30:30.200 --> 01:30:32.200]  Basically.
[01:30:32.200 --> 01:30:35.200]  I literally can't free you.
[01:30:35.200 --> 01:30:41.200]  Can people look at Gavin Mikewick in his video?
[01:30:41.200 --> 01:30:44.200]  Yup.
[01:30:44.200 --> 01:30:46.200]  He's playing his character well.
[01:30:46.200 --> 01:30:50.200]  I like that red.
[01:30:50.200 --> 01:30:52.200]  Very in character.
[01:30:52.200 --> 01:30:54.200]  Yup. Very much.
[01:30:54.200 --> 01:30:57.200]  Go get my XP for that.
[01:30:57.200 --> 01:30:59.200]  Just so you know, it's very hot under this.
[01:30:59.200 --> 01:31:01.200]  I imagine so.
[01:31:01.200 --> 01:31:03.200]  Yeah, I like that.
[01:31:03.200 --> 01:31:09.200]  In contrast, your body in game is very cold.
[01:31:09.200 --> 01:31:12.200]  Might not ever be warm again.
[01:31:12.200 --> 01:31:15.200]  That is very true.
[01:31:15.200 --> 01:31:17.200]  Like a rocket raccoon screaming Kiff.
[01:31:17.200 --> 01:31:19.200]  God damn it.
[01:31:19.200 --> 01:31:21.200]  Wait, wait, wait.
[01:31:21.200 --> 01:31:24.200]  I think it's time to do the dummer.
[01:31:24.200 --> 01:31:27.200]  I want it to be that way because it'll smell.
[01:31:27.200 --> 01:31:34.200]  Please just tell me the dummer lady isn't there yet.
[01:31:34.200 --> 01:31:41.200]  What's the price for necrophilia?
[01:31:41.200 --> 01:31:45.200]  He recently moved to Saddle Hill in the game.
[01:31:45.200 --> 01:31:52.200]  So we got three years before we had to worry about that.
[01:31:52.200 --> 01:31:57.200]  Do y'all make it to the city?
[01:31:57.200 --> 01:31:59.200]  At this point, we're on our way.
[01:31:59.200 --> 01:32:05.200]  Yup.
[01:32:05.200 --> 01:32:12.200]  I will throw something at you.
[01:32:12.200 --> 01:32:13.200]  I was muted.
[01:32:13.200 --> 01:32:14.200]  They have no idea what I said.
[01:32:14.200 --> 01:32:17.200]  So Melody was singing.
[01:32:17.200 --> 01:32:22.200]  Making my way downtown.
[01:32:22.200 --> 01:32:23.200]  I already got them once.
[01:32:23.200 --> 01:32:27.200]  I'm trying my best not to do it again.
[01:32:27.200 --> 01:32:31.200]  I thought it earlier, but I didn't say it.
[01:32:31.200 --> 01:32:36.200]  So you guys continue along the gold road back to the Imperial City.
[01:32:36.200 --> 01:32:40.200]  It's easy to find these when I drop them.
[01:32:40.200 --> 01:32:44.200]  Is that three days I'm going to have to roll a hunger check?
[01:32:44.200 --> 01:32:47.200]  That doesn't mean five days.
[01:32:47.200 --> 01:32:48.200]  Five?
[01:32:48.200 --> 01:32:50.200]  I thought it was three.
[01:32:50.200 --> 01:32:52.200]  I said five before.
[01:32:52.200 --> 01:32:55.200]  It was three because I ran.
[01:32:55.200 --> 01:32:57.200]  Oh, okay.
[01:32:57.200 --> 01:33:01.200]  So a quadruped can run a lot faster on a peatage.
[01:33:01.200 --> 01:33:02.200]  Yup.
[01:33:02.200 --> 01:33:04.200]  All right.
[01:33:04.200 --> 01:33:07.200]  Do you mind if I just do these all now or is there random encounters?
[01:33:07.200 --> 01:33:11.200]  Go ahead.
[01:33:11.200 --> 01:33:13.200]  All right, I can re-roll these.
[01:33:13.200 --> 01:33:16.200]  So day one fail.
[01:33:16.200 --> 01:33:18.200]  Day two pass.
[01:33:18.200 --> 01:33:23.200]  Day three pass.
[01:33:23.200 --> 01:33:25.200]  Day four fail.
[01:33:25.200 --> 01:33:31.200]  I'm going to go hunting because I'll get slightly hungry.
[01:33:31.200 --> 01:33:32.200]  Yup.
[01:33:32.200 --> 01:33:41.200]  I think I need to roll mine.
[01:33:41.200 --> 01:33:45.200]  Third day I need to hunt because I lose my stuff.
[01:33:45.200 --> 01:33:47.200]  You can just drink off of me.
[01:33:47.200 --> 01:33:52.200]  I don't give a shit right now.
[01:33:52.200 --> 01:33:58.200]  My character is literally emotionally fucked.
[01:33:58.200 --> 01:34:08.200]  Whenever we are back I need to hunt again.
[01:34:08.200 --> 01:34:11.200]  Do you just want me to roll survival for that?
[01:34:11.200 --> 01:34:12.200]  Yes, go ahead.
[01:34:12.200 --> 01:34:15.200]  I guess I can use the beast skillet.
[01:34:15.200 --> 01:34:17.200]  I'm going to the bathroom real quick.
[01:34:17.200 --> 01:34:18.200]  Okay.
[01:34:18.200 --> 01:34:20.200]  Check your phone by the way, Gavin.
[01:34:20.200 --> 01:34:25.200]  No.
[01:34:25.200 --> 01:34:27.200]  I'll let him look.
[01:34:27.200 --> 01:34:30.200]  Day one, not able to check anything.
[01:34:30.200 --> 01:34:36.200]  So day five I'll have to make another check and then really end the game.
[01:34:36.200 --> 01:34:39.200]  Gavin can hear us.
[01:34:39.200 --> 01:34:41.200]  And I hunt something successfully.
[01:34:41.200 --> 01:34:42.200]  But zero degrees.
[01:34:42.200 --> 01:34:45.200]  So what do I spawn?
[01:34:45.200 --> 01:34:47.200]  At this point it's close to 50.
[01:34:47.200 --> 01:35:03.200]  Um...
[01:35:03.200 --> 01:35:06.200]  I'll go back.
[01:35:06.200 --> 01:35:08.200]  Okay.
[01:35:08.200 --> 01:35:11.200]  I am going to head back.
[01:35:11.200 --> 01:35:12.200]  I'll go to Gavin.
[01:35:12.200 --> 01:35:14.200]  Check your phone.
[01:35:14.200 --> 01:35:32.200]  I'll send you a message.
[01:35:32.200 --> 01:35:34.200]  Sorry, I've been holding that for a while.
[01:35:34.200 --> 01:35:36.200]  Bad question.
[01:35:36.200 --> 01:35:46.200]  Did the infert want to check out what happened to Kvatch?
[01:35:46.200 --> 01:35:51.200]  It was more it happened and it seemed to be something that...
[01:35:51.200 --> 01:35:52.200]  You cut out, dude.
[01:35:52.200 --> 01:35:59.200]  Oh my god.
[01:35:59.200 --> 01:36:02.200]  Okay, talk.
[01:36:02.200 --> 01:36:09.200]  So it was more following his destiny is what he felt like doing.
[01:36:09.200 --> 01:36:12.200]  So hold up.
[01:36:12.200 --> 01:36:15.200]  By the fifth day you are...
[01:36:15.200 --> 01:36:21.200]  While you guys are taking a break, you head off into the woods to...
[01:36:21.200 --> 01:36:24.200]  And start following contracts.
[01:36:24.200 --> 01:36:35.200]  As far as you can tell, there are about three deer that are moving towards this clearing.
[01:36:35.200 --> 01:36:45.200]  As you quietly begin stalking and moving up into the clearing, make me an observation check.
[01:36:45.200 --> 01:36:47.200]  Okay, I need to check if I can...
[01:36:47.200 --> 01:36:48.200]  Because I would be transformed.
[01:36:48.200 --> 01:36:50.200]  I need to check if I can use...
[01:36:50.200 --> 01:36:52.200]  Oh, you are transformed?
[01:36:52.200 --> 01:36:54.200]  Well, I have to be to actually feed, so...
[01:36:54.200 --> 01:36:56.200]  That's right, yep. Okay.
[01:36:56.200 --> 01:37:04.200]  I have to do it. That's what we agreed on, so...
[01:37:04.200 --> 01:37:09.200]  And if she's found tracks, she's going to assume something, you know...
[01:37:09.200 --> 01:37:12.200]  I was going to read the skill and see if I can...
[01:37:12.200 --> 01:37:14.200]  I believe it can be used in the place of observation.
[01:37:14.200 --> 01:37:17.200]  It can.
[01:37:17.200 --> 01:37:21.200]  I'm asking because I can just roll a strength check, which is still better in my observe.
[01:37:21.200 --> 01:37:23.200]  Yeah, two degrees.
[01:37:23.200 --> 01:37:25.200]  Okay.
[01:37:25.200 --> 01:37:37.200]  As you begin on all fours, walking to the edge of this clearing, trying to just get eyes on it between bushes...
[01:37:37.200 --> 01:37:51.200]  Across the clearing, you see the shape of a very large wolf head poking through doing the same thing you're doing.
[01:37:51.200 --> 01:37:57.200]  She will back off from that.
[01:37:57.200 --> 01:38:01.200]  Because she doesn't have her weapons right now, and she has a silver weapon.
[01:38:01.200 --> 01:38:03.200]  Okay.
[01:38:03.200 --> 01:38:05.200]  Start with me.
[01:38:05.200 --> 01:38:11.200]  She'll back off to the side, and while hiding, she'll watch what goes down.
[01:38:11.200 --> 01:38:13.200]  Okay.
[01:38:13.200 --> 01:38:15.200]  Should I roll a stealth check here?
[01:38:15.200 --> 01:38:18.200]  Go on and roll a stealth check.
[01:38:18.200 --> 01:38:21.200]  Which I believe you can also use the instincts thing for that.
[01:38:21.200 --> 01:38:24.200]  Yep, I just did. Three degrees.
[01:38:24.200 --> 01:38:25.200]  Okay.
[01:38:25.200 --> 01:38:29.200]  Not three, but...
[01:38:29.200 --> 01:38:35.200]  Alright, so ahead of you, you see these three...
[01:38:35.200 --> 01:38:37.200]  ...dows.
[01:38:37.200 --> 01:38:39.200]  Grazing.
[01:38:39.200 --> 01:38:47.200]  And you watch as this...
[01:38:47.200 --> 01:38:49.200]  ...wolf...
[01:38:49.200 --> 01:38:55.200]  ...begins coming a bit more out of the brush and just charges.
[01:38:55.200 --> 01:38:57.200]  Werewolf?
[01:38:57.200 --> 01:39:00.200]  Yes, 100% Lycanthrope.
[01:39:00.200 --> 01:39:01.200]  Okay.
[01:39:01.200 --> 01:39:25.200]  Go ahead and roll me a attack check, please.
[01:39:25.200 --> 01:39:30.200]  Seven degrees of success.
[01:39:30.200 --> 01:39:31.200]  Oh!
[01:39:31.200 --> 01:39:34.200]  Roll damage.
[01:39:34.200 --> 01:39:38.200]  Hold on, I gotta pull up the actual damage that...
[01:39:38.200 --> 01:39:40.200]  That's a dead deer.
[01:39:40.200 --> 01:39:42.200]  Fucking dead as fuck, deer.
[01:39:42.200 --> 01:39:44.200]  Fucking dead as fuck.
[01:39:44.200 --> 01:39:50.200]  I'm assuming you have the one that lets you add your strength.
[01:39:50.200 --> 01:39:55.200]  No, I just have really high combat capability.
[01:39:55.200 --> 01:39:56.200]  Yeah.
[01:39:56.200 --> 01:40:00.200]  And with the addition of Lycanthrope...
[01:40:00.200 --> 01:40:02.200]  You cut out.
[01:40:02.200 --> 01:40:08.200]  With the addition of Lycanthrope features, I get 75 on my comp.
[01:40:08.200 --> 01:40:10.200]  Yeah.
[01:40:10.200 --> 01:40:15.200]  Not to mention, you can go up to adept now with 4000.
[01:40:15.200 --> 01:40:18.200]  My character's not quite 4000.
[01:40:18.200 --> 01:40:20.200]  Oh, his character's not at 4000?
[01:40:20.200 --> 01:40:21.200]  Not quite.
[01:40:21.200 --> 01:40:24.200]  Well, probably at the exact point in the adventure, yes.
[01:40:24.200 --> 01:40:28.200]  Because we probably got something for, you know...
[01:40:28.200 --> 01:40:31.200]  Oh, I'm not even up to 4000 yet.
[01:40:31.200 --> 01:40:33.200]  Well, I'm not really shy.
[01:40:33.200 --> 01:40:35.200]  Yeah.
[01:40:35.200 --> 01:40:39.200]  Okay, rolling a D10 for my slashing claws.
[01:40:39.200 --> 01:40:41.200]  Yeah.
[01:40:41.200 --> 01:40:43.200]  You'll add your strength.
[01:40:43.200 --> 01:40:46.200]  That is a nine on the dice.
[01:40:46.200 --> 01:40:51.200]  I roll a D10 that lets me dash twice, do you?
[01:40:51.200 --> 01:40:53.200]  Um, huh?
[01:40:53.200 --> 01:40:57.200]  You don't have the feat that lets you add your strength twice on every attack, do you?
[01:40:57.200 --> 01:40:59.200]  No, no.
[01:40:59.200 --> 01:41:03.200]  I have the feat that lets me dash for free every round.
[01:41:03.200 --> 01:41:04.200]  Okay.
[01:41:04.200 --> 01:41:06.200]  Directly at somebody.
[01:41:06.200 --> 01:41:10.200]  That is a... that would be 14.
[01:41:10.200 --> 01:41:12.200]  14.
[01:41:12.200 --> 01:41:15.200]  You rolled a nine on the dice.
[01:41:15.200 --> 01:41:19.200]  The minimum I could do with the claw if I rolled a one is 13.
[01:41:19.200 --> 01:41:23.200]  So... yeah.
[01:41:23.200 --> 01:41:25.200]  Yeah, my guy's fast.
[01:41:25.200 --> 01:41:27.200]  That's what werewolves are good at.
[01:41:27.200 --> 01:41:29.200]  They're fast, they're agile.
[01:41:29.200 --> 01:41:31.200]  Yeah.
[01:41:31.200 --> 01:41:36.200]  Werebears are just brutal and then wereboars are just impossible to kill.
[01:41:36.200 --> 01:41:39.200]  Yeah, they got just very high toughness.
[01:41:39.200 --> 01:41:41.200]  They hide.
[01:41:41.200 --> 01:41:43.200]  Yeah.
[01:41:43.200 --> 01:41:46.200]  And they're all about charging attacks.
[01:41:46.200 --> 01:41:47.200]  Yeah.
[01:41:47.200 --> 01:41:51.200]  Werebears just have straight raw damage.
[01:41:51.200 --> 01:41:58.200]  Um, alright, so, uh... yeah, I got it.
[01:41:58.200 --> 01:42:00.200]  I elbow.
[01:42:00.200 --> 01:42:04.200]  Sorry, Melody, you stepped out, so I have to close the door.
[01:42:04.200 --> 01:42:09.200]  Um, yeah, you just rush at this thing.
[01:42:09.200 --> 01:42:11.200]  I'm sorry, that would have been a D12, but oh well.
[01:42:11.200 --> 01:42:13.200]  It's still dead.
[01:42:13.200 --> 01:42:15.200]  Yeah, it's still dead.
[01:42:15.200 --> 01:42:31.200]  Uh... slam your claw down on the back of its neck and you just hear a crack as the neck breaks and you bring it down with that strike.
[01:42:31.200 --> 01:42:43.200]  Knowing that there's now for sure a werewolf out here, I'm going to try to sneak away back to camp to warn everyone that there's werewolf hunting in the woods right now.
[01:42:43.200 --> 01:42:47.200]  Should I roll a...
[01:42:47.200 --> 01:42:50.200]  Observation or your instinct?
[01:42:50.200 --> 01:42:53.200]  Yep, and I'll roll mine too because I'm moving, so I'm assuming a different roll.
[01:42:53.200 --> 01:42:56.200]  Yep.
[01:42:56.200 --> 01:43:01.200]  Um, real quick, where would my instinct stuff be?
[01:43:01.200 --> 01:43:06.200]  So, it won't be on your character sheet because it is not a base skill?
[01:43:06.200 --> 01:43:08.200]  You haven't added them yet?
[01:43:08.200 --> 01:43:11.200]  You have to add them? Uh, give me a second.
[01:43:11.200 --> 01:43:17.200]  Why do you move my straight stats? Because I don't actually get a skill because I'm not taking that elite advance.
[01:43:17.200 --> 01:43:19.200]  You have it.
[01:43:19.200 --> 01:43:21.200]  It's important for me.
[01:43:21.200 --> 01:43:23.200]  Yeah, for you it's important.
[01:43:23.200 --> 01:43:24.200]  Yeah, I have.
[01:43:24.200 --> 01:43:26.200]  What do you do with the skill?
[01:43:26.200 --> 01:43:30.200]  Unless you took talents, you are...
[01:43:30.200 --> 01:43:34.200]  Uhhhh... apprentice.
[01:43:34.200 --> 01:43:35.200]  Yep.
[01:43:35.200 --> 01:43:37.200]  I have...
[01:43:37.200 --> 01:43:43.200]  Yeah, hold on. I took two talents. Thrill of the Hunt and Gorgeing Feast.
[01:43:43.200 --> 01:43:46.200]  I don't think either of those. No.
[01:43:46.200 --> 01:43:52.200]  And I don't think Thrill of the Hunt does it. Do you mean Thrill of the Charge? Or Thrill of the Chase?
[01:43:52.200 --> 01:43:53.200]  Yes, sorry.
[01:43:53.200 --> 01:43:57.200]  Yep, so Tim Heals will be apprentice.
[01:43:57.200 --> 01:43:58.200]  Yep.
[01:43:58.200 --> 01:44:01.200]  Okay, so what would...
[01:44:01.200 --> 01:44:04.200]  Your stat plus ten.
[01:44:04.200 --> 01:44:06.200]  Okay, the stat plus ten? Okay.
[01:44:06.200 --> 01:44:08.200]  Yep, and I can go off of...
[01:44:08.200 --> 01:44:11.200]  Just wanted to be sure, thank you.
[01:44:11.200 --> 01:44:14.200]  I can go off of Spring? Um...
[01:44:14.200 --> 01:44:16.200]  Let's move the Cursed section, Tim.
[01:44:16.200 --> 01:44:17.200]  Yeah.
[01:44:17.200 --> 01:44:19.200]  Just one more to four.
[01:44:19.200 --> 01:44:22.200]  Okay. I see what I gotta roll.
[01:44:22.200 --> 01:44:23.200]  Yep.
[01:44:23.200 --> 01:44:25.200]  Uhhhh...
[01:44:25.200 --> 01:44:26.200]  Yeah, that would be based on...
[01:44:26.200 --> 01:44:28.200]  Strength and agility or perception?
[01:44:28.200 --> 01:44:30.200]  Perception.
[01:44:30.200 --> 01:44:33.200]  Uhhhh...
[01:44:33.200 --> 01:44:35.200]  Four degrees of success.
[01:44:35.200 --> 01:44:37.200]  We tied, Tim.
[01:44:37.200 --> 01:44:39.200]  Wow.
[01:44:39.200 --> 01:44:42.200]  Does it go to the second digit?
[01:44:42.200 --> 01:44:47.200]  Okay.
[01:44:47.200 --> 01:44:50.200]  I have a fifty-thirty in perception.
[01:44:50.200 --> 01:44:53.200]  Okay.
[01:44:53.200 --> 01:44:56.200]  Oh, Moses a roll.
[01:44:56.200 --> 01:44:58.200]  Huh?
[01:44:58.200 --> 01:45:00.200]  What did you roll?
[01:45:00.200 --> 01:45:03.200]  I rolled a forty-three.
[01:45:03.200 --> 01:45:05.200]  I also rolled a forty-three.
[01:45:05.200 --> 01:45:07.200]  What the f...
[01:45:07.200 --> 01:45:11.200]  Should I just roll again?
[01:45:11.200 --> 01:45:14.200]  I'm looking that up now.
[01:45:14.200 --> 01:45:18.200]  Observe versus Stealth? I'll try to find a two.
[01:45:18.200 --> 01:45:22.200]  Uhhhh...
[01:45:22.200 --> 01:45:24.200]  Because it's different for every system.
[01:45:24.200 --> 01:45:28.200]  In D&D, if an Observer matches a Stealth check, the Observer wins.
[01:45:28.200 --> 01:45:29.200]  Yeah.
[01:45:29.200 --> 01:45:31.200]  If a Stealth check matches an AC, it wins.
[01:45:31.200 --> 01:45:34.200]  So it really depends on what they did for the system.
[01:45:34.200 --> 01:45:36.200]  Yep.
[01:45:36.200 --> 01:45:38.200]  It's probably in interpretation here.
[01:45:38.200 --> 01:45:42.200]  I can't believe we both rolled forty-thirties. That's wild.
[01:45:42.200 --> 01:45:44.200]  It's just Maisie.
[01:45:44.200 --> 01:45:46.200]  Yeah.
[01:45:46.200 --> 01:46:00.200]  I rolled the... every time Tim has called me to roll B100 with him for something out of like a one in ten thousand chance of it happening, it happens every time.
[01:46:00.200 --> 01:46:02.200]  Ummm...
[01:46:02.200 --> 01:46:07.200]  I was hoping he would do that for Dragon Blood, just to see if I had it, but...
[01:46:07.200 --> 01:46:10.200]  I don't know if he wants to risk that.
[01:46:10.200 --> 01:46:12.200]  Let's be think of that one animation.
[01:46:12.200 --> 01:46:14.200]  I've got too many bloods.
[01:46:14.200 --> 01:46:16.200]  Roll for it.
[01:46:16.200 --> 01:46:18.200]  Luck check.
[01:46:18.200 --> 01:46:23.200]  No, just a B100, we're gonna see how close we are, and I have a range in my head.
[01:46:23.200 --> 01:46:24.200]  Oh, for me?
[01:46:24.200 --> 01:46:25.200]  Yes.
[01:46:25.200 --> 01:46:30.200]  We'll do it for all the characters, we're gonna do you first, just 'cause you called it out.
[01:46:30.200 --> 01:46:32.200]  Just 'cause you know what happens?
[01:46:32.200 --> 01:46:34.200]  Umm...
[01:46:34.200 --> 01:46:38.200]  I'm also doing this while I try to figure out what happens to Ties.
[01:46:38.200 --> 01:46:48.200]  I swear to God, if the vampire Alfie Cat suddenly has Dragon Blood...
[01:46:48.200 --> 01:46:51.200]  Tim, your range was 29, was it?
[01:46:51.200 --> 01:46:52.200]  Hmm?
[01:46:52.200 --> 01:46:53.200]  29?
[01:46:53.200 --> 01:46:55.200]  I haven't rolled yet.
[01:46:55.200 --> 01:46:56.200]  Oh.
[01:46:56.200 --> 01:46:58.200]  He rolled.
[01:46:58.200 --> 01:47:00.200]  Pretty good.
[01:47:00.200 --> 01:47:01.200]  What the fuck?
[01:47:01.200 --> 01:47:02.200]  Okay, you're close.
[01:47:02.200 --> 01:47:04.200]  They're very close.
[01:47:04.200 --> 01:47:06.200]  What?
[01:47:06.200 --> 01:47:07.200]  Umm...
[01:47:07.200 --> 01:47:10.200]  See, how rare it is, you probably have to do it twice to have it.
[01:47:10.200 --> 01:47:18.200]  But what do we do if we both completely tie?
[01:47:18.200 --> 01:47:20.200]  Should it be a luck check then?
[01:47:20.200 --> 01:47:22.200]  'Cause I don't know if we have it opposed for itself.
[01:47:22.200 --> 01:47:27.200]  I think a luck check would be a good follow-up if we can't decide what happens on Ties.
[01:47:27.200 --> 01:47:31.200]  If we roll the exact same number, I think you're supposed to go to the second creation sometime.
[01:47:31.200 --> 01:47:32.200]  I don't know.
[01:47:32.200 --> 01:47:41.200]  Oh, do I get all my points back?
[01:47:41.200 --> 01:47:44.200]  They say have the character reroll, is what the call is.
[01:47:44.200 --> 01:47:46.200]  Okay, I'll let you tie, you reroll.
[01:47:46.200 --> 01:47:49.200]  I get all my points back, right?
[01:47:49.200 --> 01:47:50.200]  Yes.
[01:47:50.200 --> 01:47:52.200]  Oh, you might have caught me on this one, Mitho.
[01:47:52.200 --> 01:47:55.200]  Not Mitho, whatever your new guide, not Mitho.
[01:47:55.200 --> 01:47:56.200]  You don't know yet.
[01:47:56.200 --> 01:47:58.200]  But lucky no.
[01:47:58.200 --> 01:48:00.200]  I rolled a one degree of success.
[01:48:00.200 --> 01:48:03.200]  You will probably notice some movement in the bushes.
[01:48:03.200 --> 01:48:06.200]  I'm going to use the restroom.
[01:48:06.200 --> 01:48:20.200]  You notice after you've killed this thing, after you've killed this gear, something begins moving in the opposite to your side of clearing away.
[01:48:20.200 --> 01:48:31.200]  If you look back, you will note that his eyes are dead set on your location.
[01:48:31.200 --> 01:48:33.200]  I don't know if I cut out right there.
[01:48:33.200 --> 01:48:35.200]  I'm getting a lot of lag spikes.
[01:48:35.200 --> 01:48:43.200]  And he lets in a big, just a hearty sniff.
[01:48:43.200 --> 01:48:46.200]  I don't know if that picked up.
[01:48:46.200 --> 01:48:49.200]  It did, but we getcha.
[01:48:49.200 --> 01:48:52.200]  Yeah, that didn't, but yeah.
[01:48:52.200 --> 01:48:57.200]  I mean, she's getting out of there because she's going to warn everyone because she doesn't know if she can trust you to be...
[01:48:57.200 --> 01:49:02.200]  She could be feral for all she knows, and she doesn't count herself a good fighter as a hero.
[01:49:02.200 --> 01:49:05.200]  Three months, so it's six weeks.
[01:49:05.200 --> 01:49:08.200]  You just hear a voice shout.
[01:49:08.200 --> 01:49:11.200]  What, you're going to let somebody take your hunts?
[01:49:11.200 --> 01:49:12.200]  Six days.
[01:49:12.200 --> 01:49:17.200]  And I will immediately dash at your direction.
[01:49:17.200 --> 01:49:22.200]  I've got a point where we need to worry.
[01:49:22.200 --> 01:49:25.200]  What is your speed, Gavin?
[01:49:25.200 --> 01:49:27.200]  My speed is 15, but I have...
[01:49:27.200 --> 01:49:29.200]  You accept a lot from me.
[01:49:29.200 --> 01:49:30.200]  Dash for free.
[01:49:30.200 --> 01:49:34.200]  I also have quadruped and I have a 14, so pretty much the same.
[01:49:34.200 --> 01:49:35.200]  Actually, no.
[01:49:35.200 --> 01:49:37.200]  Right now I have a 16.
[01:49:37.200 --> 01:49:39.200]  I'm not an armorman.
[01:49:39.200 --> 01:49:41.200]  Ah.
[01:49:41.200 --> 01:49:44.200]  I can dash for free.
[01:49:44.200 --> 01:49:45.200]  Entirely free.
[01:49:45.200 --> 01:49:48.200]  You require stamina points. All that.
[01:49:48.200 --> 01:49:51.200]  Well, dash is an action point, I think.
[01:49:51.200 --> 01:49:53.200]  Oh yeah, it doesn't cost me one.
[01:49:53.200 --> 01:49:57.200]  With the thrill of the chase.
[01:49:57.200 --> 01:49:59.200]  A chase?
[01:49:59.200 --> 01:50:02.200]  Yeah, he gets an extra dash. I have a higher speed.
[01:50:02.200 --> 01:50:05.200]  How does that work, Tim?
[01:50:05.200 --> 01:50:07.200]  You're supposed to have quadruped, right?
[01:50:07.200 --> 01:50:08.200]  Yes.
[01:50:08.200 --> 01:50:14.200]  We both have a real transformable quadruped. I just have one higher speed than he does, but he gets a free dash.
[01:50:14.200 --> 01:50:19.200]  Right, so quadruped, what that does is...
[01:50:19.200 --> 01:50:20.200]  It, right?
[01:50:20.200 --> 01:50:22.200]  Yeah.
[01:50:22.200 --> 01:50:26.200]  I mean, it doesn't matter because we can both dash faster.
[01:50:26.200 --> 01:50:29.200]  But he can get one additional dash out.
[01:50:29.200 --> 01:50:34.200]  Yeah, dash. How quick does he catch me?
[01:50:34.200 --> 01:50:40.200]  Can I say, I catch you right as you get to the camp?
[01:50:40.200 --> 01:50:42.200]  I'd allow it.
[01:50:42.200 --> 01:50:47.200]  She'll come, like, hold us. The rest of you will be sitting at camp. I don't know what you're doing.
[01:50:47.200 --> 01:50:52.200]  Hold it. You'll hear, you know, a literal bear running through the wood.
[01:50:52.200 --> 01:50:55.200]  Did you tell us about this?
[01:50:55.200 --> 01:50:57.200]  You know she's a lycanthrope.
[01:50:57.200 --> 01:50:59.200]  I've never seen her transformed.
[01:50:59.200 --> 01:51:01.200]  You've just never seen me transform.
[01:51:01.200 --> 01:51:03.200]  You're in reda, babe.
[01:51:03.200 --> 01:51:08.200]  What? What happened? Who rolled? Who died?
[01:51:08.200 --> 01:51:15.200]  Lucky number. I stealth as I see, you know, like, praising this out of this way. Stealth. Lucky number.
[01:51:15.200 --> 01:51:26.200]  As she gets to camp, she'll just yell out "werewolf" and, you know, then turn around to fight with everyone else around.
[01:51:26.200 --> 01:51:31.200]  I have never rolled a lucky number this entire session. I've rolled it twice now.
[01:51:31.200 --> 01:51:34.200]  Woooooo!
[01:51:34.200 --> 01:51:50.200]  Um, as Holda comes bursting out of the tree line, you and your werewolf, he immediately skids to a stop right at the tree line, staring out at everybody.
[01:51:50.200 --> 01:51:58.200]  Having taken a good look at that thing, I'm going to send a picture and character.
[01:51:58.200 --> 01:52:00.200]  Yeah, we can see character now.
[01:52:00.200 --> 01:52:07.200]  Sounds great. We can see Tessendra. Tessendra is gone. Tessendra is the trees.
[01:52:07.200 --> 01:52:12.200]  Yeah.
[01:52:12.200 --> 01:52:17.200]  That is the wrong picture.
[01:52:17.200 --> 01:52:20.200]  Delete it.
[01:52:20.200 --> 01:52:25.200]  Nope. Too late. Nope. Too late.
[01:52:25.200 --> 01:52:30.200]  I was saying something to a friend at work. I made that face and he just snapped a picture of me.
[01:52:30.200 --> 01:52:34.200]  Nope. Too late, Gavin. That's your character art. It's too late.
[01:52:34.200 --> 01:52:41.200]  Too bad.
[01:52:41.200 --> 01:52:43.200]  That was a little bit too funny.
[01:52:43.200 --> 01:52:47.200]  That was really the wrong picture. That was really funny.
[01:52:47.200 --> 01:52:52.200]  You could have sent the wrong picture. That could have been way, way, way, way, way worse.
[01:52:52.200 --> 01:52:56.200]  Yeah.
[01:52:56.200 --> 01:53:06.200]  And you will see this very aggressive looking werewolf standing at the edge of the.
[01:53:06.200 --> 01:53:11.200]  Are there non aggressive looking werewolves?
[01:53:11.200 --> 01:53:12.200]  I guess not.
[01:53:12.200 --> 01:53:15.200]  Cute fluffy ones.
[01:53:15.200 --> 01:53:22.200]  My character token is a really cute werebear. If you flip my character token, Tim.
[01:53:22.200 --> 01:53:24.200]  Yeah, that's also just the artist style.
[01:53:24.200 --> 01:53:26.200]  Wait, let me. Let me.
[01:53:26.200 --> 01:53:29.200]  How do you flip them, Tim?
[01:53:29.200 --> 01:53:40.200]  I think if the werewolf wasn't snarling and showing its teeth, it could be cute. They're just going to look like a vaguely humanoid wolf.
[01:53:40.200 --> 01:53:44.200]  First time you'll see Hilda looking like a werebear.
[01:53:44.200 --> 01:53:46.200]  A werebear for.
[01:53:46.200 --> 01:53:50.200]  Oh, the wolf probably does stand taller than him.
[01:53:50.200 --> 01:53:58.200]  But there's something about Hothis's stance that just.
[01:53:58.200 --> 01:54:01.200]  Hothis, or is his name.
[01:54:01.200 --> 01:54:06.200]  It's it's taken from the language from.
[01:54:06.200 --> 01:54:08.200]  You keep on cutting out, man.
[01:54:08.200 --> 01:54:10.200]  Yeah.
[01:54:10.200 --> 01:54:11.200]  Is that better?
[01:54:11.200 --> 01:54:15.200]  My last session, whoever had done last session worked great.
[01:54:15.200 --> 01:54:17.200]  I think I know what's going on.
[01:54:17.200 --> 01:54:18.200]  Give me a second.
[01:54:18.200 --> 01:54:25.200]  I think you need to just kind of fix the the gain or whatever the sensitivity.
[01:54:25.200 --> 01:54:27.200]  Yeah, I'll try a little bit better.
[01:54:27.200 --> 01:54:30.200]  It was kind of not working sometimes.
[01:54:30.200 --> 01:54:32.200]  How do I sound now?
[01:54:32.200 --> 01:54:33.200]  Better.
[01:54:33.200 --> 01:54:34.200]  Okay.
[01:54:34.200 --> 01:54:37.200]  It was stuck on voice mod mic again.
[01:54:37.200 --> 01:54:38.200]  Ah.
[01:54:38.200 --> 01:54:44.200]  Oh, anyways, let me you're looking out at us.
[01:54:44.200 --> 01:54:49.200]  Yeah, he's just he's danced up and all.
[01:54:49.200 --> 01:54:54.200]  But he.
[01:54:54.200 --> 01:54:57.200]  You know, show yourself.
[01:54:57.200 --> 01:54:59.200]  Huh?
[01:54:59.200 --> 01:55:00.200]  Sorry, say that again.
[01:55:00.200 --> 01:55:05.200]  Holden will call out to him, show yourself or die because she doesn't trust a feral.
[01:55:05.200 --> 01:55:13.200]  What might be a feral where she doesn't know if you're a feral or not yet.
[01:55:13.200 --> 01:55:27.200]  He takes a step forward and if Tim is OK with this, he will toss out the deer carcass to you.
[01:55:27.200 --> 01:55:30.200]  You look tongue agree.
[01:55:30.200 --> 01:55:40.200]  Holden, she's not that great. She just like not well fed anymore.
[01:55:40.200 --> 01:55:41.200]  Thank you.
[01:55:41.200 --> 01:55:48.200]  She'll not send to send her up in the trees, ready to pounce.
[01:55:48.200 --> 01:55:51.200]  And she'll eat the deer in front of everyone.
[01:55:51.200 --> 01:55:54.200]  I'm sure that's gruesome.
[01:55:54.200 --> 01:55:57.200]  We only see one gruesome, my friend.
[01:55:57.200 --> 01:56:00.200]  Oh, I know you got we have seen worse in the past like five days.
[01:56:00.200 --> 01:56:08.200]  So this actually is.
[01:56:08.200 --> 01:56:13.200]  What are you doing here?
[01:56:13.200 --> 01:56:28.200]  No, Trishy fetishes eating while you get while you have a conversation. He's going around behind the car and he pulls back on and on transforming.
[01:56:28.200 --> 01:56:31.200]  Did you hear the question I asked?
[01:56:31.200 --> 01:56:32.200]  No, but.
[01:56:32.200 --> 01:56:37.200]  Oh, I said, what are you doing here?
[01:56:37.200 --> 01:56:39.200]  Traveling on the road.
[01:56:39.200 --> 01:56:44.200]  You're a little far off the road, aren't you?
[01:56:44.200 --> 01:56:47.200]  It's not deer on the road.
[01:56:47.200 --> 01:56:53.200]  You should even.
[01:56:53.200 --> 01:56:54.200]  Oh, I see.
[01:56:54.200 --> 01:57:00.200]  Well, can you give me a moment, though?
[01:57:00.200 --> 01:57:11.200]  I cannot transform as long as you can, Kevin. That's one of the things I think you'd get is a longer one. So she has to go put some clothes on real soon.
[01:57:11.200 --> 01:57:14.200]  And she would actually rather fight you armored.
[01:57:14.200 --> 01:57:20.200]  Yeah.
[01:57:20.200 --> 01:57:33.200]  I don't I think I might win in a werewolf form. I know I'll win like with silver weapons and armor and like that's how you build a weapon.
[01:57:33.200 --> 01:57:37.200]  And they are talking to Mike.
[01:57:37.200 --> 01:57:42.200]  Yeah.
[01:57:42.200 --> 01:57:44.200]  Don't deep throat the mic.
[01:57:44.200 --> 01:57:48.200]  I mean, or do is this.
[01:57:48.200 --> 01:57:53.200]  No, no, no.
[01:57:53.200 --> 01:57:55.200]  I don't know what's wrong with all this.
[01:57:55.200 --> 01:57:57.200]  OK, OK, you sound you sound good now.
[01:57:57.200 --> 01:58:02.200]  OK, there's something wrong with the Internet connection, I think.
[01:58:02.200 --> 01:58:03.200]  Really weird.
[01:58:03.200 --> 01:58:06.200]  Say the least.
[01:58:06.200 --> 01:58:10.200]  He'll bow his head in a way that's just like, go ahead.
[01:58:10.200 --> 01:58:14.200]  He doesn't seem like he wants to fight, but.
[01:58:14.200 --> 01:58:22.200]  The fact that you're not rapidly attacking him the moment or rapidly attacking the entire party the moment anyone like the moment I ran into camp tells me you're not feral.
[01:58:22.200 --> 01:58:26.200]  So she's not as concerned about you. She's still concerned, but not like.
[01:58:26.200 --> 01:58:30.200]  If you were feral, you would just be attacking us immediately.
[01:58:30.200 --> 01:58:44.200]  He'll start kind of pacing around closer to the edge of the brush and he doesn't exactly rush anyone, but he gets a little too close for comfort through the closest person.
[01:58:44.200 --> 01:58:52.200]  Whoever the closest person is at this point, because Holder would be changing into armor and that takes a lot second.
[01:58:52.200 --> 01:58:55.200]  Well, I mean, she also have to change into clothes first.
[01:58:55.200 --> 01:58:58.200]  Yeah, all that.
[01:58:58.200 --> 01:59:02.200]  You just constantly you're just hearing the word.
[01:59:02.200 --> 01:59:06.200]  His footsteps circling around the camp and everything.
[01:59:06.200 --> 01:59:10.200]  It's very it's very uncomfortable.
[01:59:10.200 --> 01:59:15.200]  How would you feel the first thing she went to grab when she grabbed her clothes was a silver spear?
[01:59:15.200 --> 01:59:24.200]  Yeah, and who wants to be the person that gets uncomfortably close with this work?
[01:59:24.200 --> 01:59:28.200]  I'm letting you out here. I go see where it is.
[01:59:28.200 --> 01:59:32.200]  The innocent one.
[01:59:32.200 --> 01:59:36.200]  I want to lean kind of close to you and be like, Hi, I'm Coral.
[01:59:36.200 --> 01:59:41.200]  What's your name?
[01:59:41.200 --> 01:59:45.200]  I love this. I love this already.
[01:59:45.200 --> 01:59:48.200]  I don't know, but it's great.
[01:59:48.200 --> 01:59:54.200]  You are so innocent. You make my day a lot better.
[01:59:54.200 --> 01:59:58.200]  You'll probably hear behind the court.
[01:59:58.200 --> 02:00:07.200]  He leans in and he will take a a sniff to figure out what y'all have been doing recently.
[02:00:07.200 --> 02:00:09.200]  I am by the dead body.
[02:00:09.200 --> 02:00:13.200]  Yeah, there's a dead body, which if you touch.
[02:00:13.200 --> 02:00:15.200]  You cut out Maisie.
[02:00:15.200 --> 02:00:22.200]  Oh, I said, yeah, if he touches the body, that's going to be bad.
[02:00:22.200 --> 02:00:28.200]  If I may make a perception check on this based off of smell.
[02:00:28.200 --> 02:00:32.200]  Basically, I'm trying to see if I smell me those blood on them.
[02:00:32.200 --> 02:00:38.200]  Are you OK? Here you go.
[02:00:38.200 --> 02:00:40.200]  Snacky baby.
[02:00:40.200 --> 02:00:46.200]  I've been watching her constantly trying to take some of your death.
[02:00:46.200 --> 02:00:49.200]  She does.
[02:00:49.200 --> 02:00:53.200]  Um, I'm looking for something.
[02:00:53.200 --> 02:00:55.200]  Sorry.
[02:00:55.200 --> 02:00:58.200]  You have a natural sense of smell.
[02:00:58.200 --> 02:01:00.200]  Are you being a bother?
[02:01:00.200 --> 02:01:02.200]  I don't know how that works.
[02:01:02.200 --> 02:01:04.200]  It gives me advantage.
[02:01:04.200 --> 02:01:08.200]  If you're a but you're a choir smell.
[02:01:08.200 --> 02:01:10.200]  Oh, it just gives you advantage.
[02:01:10.200 --> 02:01:11.200]  I believe it says that.
[02:01:11.200 --> 02:01:12.200]  Yeah.
[02:01:12.200 --> 02:01:20.200]  I'll pull it up.
[02:01:20.200 --> 02:01:21.200]  Sorry.
[02:01:21.200 --> 02:01:28.200]  Had to put on my mom voice.
[02:01:28.200 --> 02:01:31.200]  Back to coral.
[02:01:31.200 --> 02:01:39.200]  Yeah, a natural senses six, which means you can you can perceive.
[02:01:39.200 --> 02:01:47.200]  So important thing to know with your smell in human form, you have or I guess mortal form, because in theory you could be a belt.
[02:01:47.200 --> 02:01:53.200]  But in your mortal form, you can you have a natural sense of smell three.
[02:01:53.200 --> 02:02:06.200]  And that means you can perceive other senses allow them to detect things specified by X within within range of X meters, even through solid objects.
[02:02:06.200 --> 02:02:11.200]  What a six to three is within three meters.
[02:02:11.200 --> 02:02:13.200]  Six is within six meters.
[02:02:13.200 --> 02:02:24.200]  Oh, OK. So like, yeah, just yeah, that the the number just just determines the distance of the range.
[02:02:24.200 --> 02:02:27.200]  No, I.
[02:02:27.200 --> 02:02:31.200]  You can smell a cat, but you can't see a cat.
[02:02:31.200 --> 02:02:46.200]  It gives you a form of blind sense or blind sight from D&D just off the mouth. But if you like to use your bestial stuff instead of normal observation, you may do that.
[02:02:46.200 --> 02:02:49.200]  Uh, that is two degrees of success.
[02:02:49.200 --> 02:02:53.200]  Let me make sure that's not.
[02:02:53.200 --> 02:02:55.200]  Oh, yeah, no, I'm good.
[02:02:55.200 --> 02:03:05.200]  They don't smell too great and you recoil because right now they smell like sewage and you can smell blood.
[02:03:05.200 --> 02:03:07.200]  Then we say space tunnel.
[02:03:07.200 --> 02:03:12.200]  I think there's no way we passed on the way between the two places or three.
[02:03:12.200 --> 02:03:14.200]  Nope, I checked the map.
[02:03:14.200 --> 02:03:16.200]  Oh, we smell right side.
[02:03:16.200 --> 02:03:19.200]  I don't smell like sewage.
[02:03:19.200 --> 02:03:22.200]  It'll go. You also don't see.
[02:03:22.200 --> 02:03:27.200]  Yeah, yeah, I didn't roll high enough to sneaky.
[02:03:27.200 --> 02:03:38.200]  He's got yet to find him right now would be nine degrees because he rolled eight degrees.
[02:03:38.200 --> 02:03:43.200]  I think it's plus one to your maximum number of potential to success.
[02:03:43.200 --> 02:03:46.200]  Because we still.
[02:03:46.200 --> 02:03:50.200]  I love that gift, Trevor.
[02:03:50.200 --> 02:03:52.200]  Okay, bye.
[02:03:52.200 --> 02:03:55.200]  I think Sandra.
[02:03:55.200 --> 02:03:57.200]  Oh, what happened, sweetie?
[02:03:57.200 --> 02:03:59.200]  Oh, did she hit her face?
[02:03:59.200 --> 02:04:01.200]  Did we hit your head? Did you hit your head?
[02:04:01.200 --> 02:04:03.200]  Oh, no.
[02:04:03.200 --> 02:04:09.200]  Oh, no.
[02:04:09.200 --> 02:04:11.200]  Me mama cuddles.
[02:04:11.200 --> 02:04:17.200]  And that's why it's really sad when you're growing all the time, because what didn't hit your head a week ago will now hit your head.
[02:04:17.200 --> 02:04:20.200]  Yep.
[02:04:20.200 --> 02:04:25.200]  I think she just fell trying to dance.
[02:04:25.200 --> 02:04:29.200]  But I'll make sure move that.
[02:04:29.200 --> 02:04:31.200]  Come on, let mommy see.
[02:04:31.200 --> 02:04:46.200]  I said Gavin with with six meters is the distance of your natural senses at some point, you'd get close enough to notice the body probably you're pacing around.
[02:04:46.200 --> 02:04:49.200]  Yeah, I'm over the sewage.
[02:04:49.200 --> 02:04:52.200]  You will see him pause.
[02:04:52.200 --> 02:04:58.200]  Connect that scent of the blood on your clothes with the body.
[02:04:58.200 --> 02:05:04.200]  Although it's the smells are pungent on your own.
[02:05:04.200 --> 02:05:06.200]  They're right.
[02:05:06.200 --> 02:05:07.200]  You'll see.
[02:05:07.200 --> 02:05:08.200]  Right.
[02:05:08.200 --> 02:05:13.200]  You will notice that suddenly his expression seems to soften.
[02:05:13.200 --> 02:05:18.200]  Surprisingly for a werewolf with a soft face is not.
[02:05:18.200 --> 02:05:19.200]  I get to see often.
[02:05:19.200 --> 02:05:21.200]  You keep on cutting off.
[02:05:21.200 --> 02:05:23.200]  I hate this.
[02:05:23.200 --> 02:05:26.200]  That's why I prefer my shit.
[02:05:26.200 --> 02:05:28.200]  Ash, this has never been a problem for me before.
[02:05:28.200 --> 02:05:32.200]  Hush.
[02:05:32.200 --> 02:05:37.200]  I'm going to make you eat that mic of yours.
[02:05:37.200 --> 02:05:39.200]  Cut that noise.
[02:05:39.200 --> 02:05:44.200]  If you want at a later time, I can help trouble you like I wouldn't mind that.
[02:05:44.200 --> 02:05:45.200]  Yeah.
[02:05:45.200 --> 02:05:51.200]  This court is very I finally got my years of struggling with it to work properly.
[02:05:51.200 --> 02:05:52.200]  Okay, sorry.
[02:05:52.200 --> 02:05:53.200]  Had to cheer up.
[02:05:53.200 --> 02:06:04.200]  So he looks at everybody and looks at the the cart with the body in it.
[02:06:04.200 --> 02:06:20.200]  And he he will disappear in the woods for about 30 minutes.
[02:06:20.200 --> 02:06:23.200]  Was he around and walk away?
[02:06:23.200 --> 02:06:27.200]  He never told me his name.
[02:06:27.200 --> 02:06:32.200]  And then the other person in the picture.
[02:06:32.200 --> 02:06:34.200]  And you can't get out of the way.
[02:06:34.200 --> 02:06:36.200]  Okay, sorry.
[02:06:36.200 --> 02:06:48.200]  And he dressed in partial fur, bald head, what looks like a single blade type weapon hanging off of his wrist.
[02:06:48.200 --> 02:06:53.200]  Very, very bare minimum.
[02:06:53.200 --> 02:06:59.200]  And Holder will probably be able to tell that this is for sworn tire.
[02:06:59.200 --> 02:07:02.200]  She's not she's from the soul style, not the reach.
[02:07:02.200 --> 02:07:03.200]  Oh, OK.
[02:07:03.200 --> 02:07:06.200]  Somebody might be able to go.
[02:07:06.200 --> 02:07:14.200]  Oh, well, I was in more parts for a little bit.
[02:07:14.200 --> 02:07:21.200]  And he won me a both of you roll me a war skill.
[02:07:22.200 --> 02:07:30.200]  I'm a little bit more of a war.
[02:07:30.200 --> 02:07:33.200]  He's not gone. He's right there.
[02:07:33.200 --> 02:07:36.200]  Two degrees system.
[02:07:36.200 --> 02:07:39.200]  Tim with a minus and my target numbers are one.
[02:07:39.200 --> 02:07:43.200]  Oh, good luck.
[02:07:43.200 --> 02:07:46.200]  No, I don't think you did it.
[02:07:46.200 --> 02:07:52.200]  Oh, yeah, you got no clue. But you would despair.
[02:07:52.200 --> 02:07:55.200]  You would recognize this is the first one.
[02:07:55.200 --> 02:07:56.200]  Oh, first one.
[02:07:56.200 --> 02:08:03.200]  But at least, yeah, I'm like, I guess I look at him.
[02:08:03.200 --> 02:08:06.200]  It's like you're from Markarth.
[02:08:06.200 --> 02:08:07.200]  Yeah.
[02:08:07.200 --> 02:08:09.200]  And that reach around the area.
[02:08:09.200 --> 02:08:11.200]  Yes.
[02:08:11.200 --> 02:08:13.200]  But you're not the one that actually attacked me.
[02:08:13.200 --> 02:08:16.200]  So I do not recognize you.
[02:08:16.200 --> 02:08:20.200]  No, it was a cannibal that took me.
[02:08:20.200 --> 02:08:26.200]  You smell of blood and sorrow.
[02:08:26.200 --> 02:08:31.200]  A lot had happened.
[02:08:31.200 --> 02:08:41.200]  I can tell the body in the cart is a very large signifier.
[02:08:41.200 --> 02:08:49.200]  And by the way, you should bathe.
[02:08:49.200 --> 02:08:56.200]  Grief is a strong thing and simple care is something you need to do.
[02:08:56.200 --> 02:08:58.200]  Now you can look at him.
[02:08:58.200 --> 02:09:02.200]  There had been a lake or a creek.
[02:09:02.200 --> 02:09:08.200]  There's a stream up the way.
[02:09:08.200 --> 02:09:13.200]  Near where we found the deer, actually.
[02:09:13.200 --> 02:09:18.200]  I don't think anyone's going to fight you on going to clean.
[02:09:18.200 --> 02:09:22.200]  Because we haven't had a shower or a bath in like two weeks.
[02:09:22.200 --> 02:09:25.200]  And we've been traveling on the road and walking.
[02:09:25.200 --> 02:09:30.200]  And we're in literal sewage and also a mound of human flesh.
[02:09:30.200 --> 02:09:36.200]  It is good for the soul to clean after something bad.
[02:09:36.200 --> 02:09:39.200]  At least in my experience.
[02:09:39.200 --> 02:09:40.200]  Fucking price.
[02:09:40.200 --> 02:09:45.200]  The smell of no sewage.
[02:09:45.200 --> 02:09:49.200]  All Tessandra wants to do is bury a lead.
[02:09:49.200 --> 02:09:53.200]  Is it the same sea as Porto Cattuto?
[02:09:53.200 --> 02:09:55.200]  How do you not see that?
[02:09:55.200 --> 02:10:00.200]  You get Tessandra voice in your head, but no Tessandra.
[02:10:00.200 --> 02:10:01.200]  Oh shit.
[02:10:01.200 --> 02:10:05.200]  Which is even greater because that means you still have no idea where she is.
[02:10:05.200 --> 02:10:07.200]  He.
[02:10:07.200 --> 02:10:08.200]  Yeah.
[02:10:08.200 --> 02:10:12.200]  There's three girls in the group and two boys now.
[02:10:12.200 --> 02:10:13.200]  No, six.
[02:10:13.200 --> 02:10:15.200]  I mean, the six people.
[02:10:15.200 --> 02:10:16.200]  Seven hundred.
[02:10:16.200 --> 02:10:18.200]  Because Benny.
[02:10:18.200 --> 02:10:19.200]  Yeah.
[02:10:19.200 --> 02:10:20.200]  Right.
[02:10:20.200 --> 02:10:21.200]  Right.
[02:10:21.200 --> 02:10:22.200]  Yeah.
[02:10:22.200 --> 02:10:25.200]  All you hear in your head is.
[02:10:25.200 --> 02:10:30.200]  All Tessandra wants to do is bury a blade.
[02:10:32.200 --> 02:10:37.200]  I know I'm not insane.
[02:10:37.200 --> 02:10:39.200]  Where is that voice coming from?
[02:10:39.200 --> 02:10:40.200]  Cat.
[02:10:40.200 --> 02:10:42.200]  Nobody knows.
[02:10:42.200 --> 02:10:44.200]  He's hiding so well.
[02:10:44.200 --> 02:10:47.200]  Just just what are you hearing?
[02:10:47.200 --> 02:10:52.200]  I hear them too.
[02:10:52.200 --> 02:10:54.200]  You had jumped in here.
[02:10:54.200 --> 02:10:55.200]  Thanks for not.
[02:10:55.200 --> 02:10:56.200]  I'm glad you're not feral.
[02:10:56.200 --> 02:10:59.200]  No, no, I am not feral.
[02:10:59.200 --> 02:11:02.200]  I am simply.
[02:11:02.200 --> 02:11:07.200]  What is the word?
[02:11:07.200 --> 02:11:13.200]  The Imperials said a bit much.
[02:11:13.200 --> 02:11:15.200]  You don't have to.
[02:11:15.200 --> 02:11:17.200]  I'm incredibly flexible.
[02:11:17.200 --> 02:11:19.200]  It's a new topic.
[02:11:19.200 --> 02:11:21.200]  I've got one.
[02:11:21.200 --> 02:11:22.200]  First person you killed.
[02:11:22.200 --> 02:11:24.200]  Jesus, really?
[02:11:24.200 --> 02:11:27.200]  I try to help people where I can.
[02:11:27.200 --> 02:11:32.200]  Hey, Trevor, that's really dumb, by the way.
[02:11:32.200 --> 02:11:35.200]  I didn't know where that was coming from.
[02:11:35.200 --> 02:11:40.200]  Most apparently my noise suppression turned off randomly.
[02:11:40.200 --> 02:11:42.200]  I love when it does that.
[02:11:42.200 --> 02:11:44.200]  For a second I thought that was Chris speaking.
[02:11:44.200 --> 02:11:46.200]  It sounded for a second like that.
[02:11:46.200 --> 02:11:47.200]  It does actually.
[02:11:47.200 --> 02:11:48.200]  Yeah.
[02:11:48.200 --> 02:11:54.200]  But I believe.
[02:11:54.200 --> 02:11:57.200]  I'm a hunter first.
[02:11:57.200 --> 02:11:58.200]  That's what I do.
[02:11:58.200 --> 02:12:05.200]  And sometimes when I'm in my more true form, what I am.
[02:12:05.200 --> 02:12:11.200]  I let the excitement get to me.
[02:12:11.200 --> 02:12:12.200]  Did you hear what she said?
[02:12:12.200 --> 02:12:14.200]  No, I didn't catch that.
[02:12:14.200 --> 02:12:16.200]  You said that's not your true form.
[02:12:16.200 --> 02:12:18.200]  It is to me.
[02:12:18.200 --> 02:12:19.200]  What the?
[02:12:19.200 --> 02:12:20.200]  I turned Australian.
[02:12:20.200 --> 02:12:23.200]  What the fuck?
[02:12:23.200 --> 02:12:26.200]  I'm getting Wolverine vibes.
[02:12:26.200 --> 02:12:34.200]  I love it.
[02:12:34.200 --> 02:12:37.200]  To each their own.
[02:12:37.200 --> 02:12:39.200]  I'll kind of stare at you for a while.
[02:12:39.200 --> 02:12:42.200]  You know, when you meet like someone has a complete like, you know,
[02:12:42.200 --> 02:12:47.200]  out of something so drastic, like a complete curse that to her is a complete horrible curse.
[02:12:47.200 --> 02:12:49.200]  You consider not.
[02:12:49.200 --> 02:12:53.200]  She like she hearing you like completely aghast for a second.
[02:12:53.200 --> 02:12:57.200]  Like how could you possibly think that?
[02:12:57.200 --> 02:13:04.200]  Because I asked for it.
[02:13:04.200 --> 02:13:05.200]  Why?
[02:13:05.200 --> 02:13:11.200]  Why would anyone want that?
[02:13:11.200 --> 02:13:15.200]  For me?
[02:13:15.200 --> 02:13:20.200]  Her Richmond were already considered animals.
[02:13:20.200 --> 02:13:23.200]  I don't mind it.
[02:13:23.200 --> 02:13:27.200]  I just found to make it more true.
[02:13:27.200 --> 02:13:34.200]  Felt right.
[02:13:34.200 --> 02:13:38.200]  And like I say, some enjoy it.
[02:13:38.200 --> 02:13:44.200]  I know her scene doesn't like the fact that we don't like what he bestowed upon.
[02:13:44.200 --> 02:13:51.200]  I can kiss my ass.
[02:13:51.200 --> 02:13:54.200]  You will see.
[02:13:54.200 --> 02:13:56.200]  Office.
[02:13:56.200 --> 02:13:58.200]  Burrow his brow.
[02:13:58.200 --> 02:14:01.200]  That does upset him a little bit.
[02:14:01.200 --> 02:14:05.200]  But he holds his tongue.
[02:14:05.200 --> 02:14:09.200]  Because of the fact that you're in mourning.
[02:14:09.200 --> 02:14:14.200]  She still would be saying she hates it.
[02:14:14.200 --> 02:14:22.200]  I am more or less lost.
[02:14:22.200 --> 02:14:26.200]  I'm looking for a good.
[02:14:26.200 --> 02:14:31.200]  To say the least.
[02:14:31.200 --> 02:14:36.200]  Yeah, we're looking to hunt.
[02:14:36.200 --> 02:14:42.200]  Something.
[02:14:42.200 --> 02:14:44.200]  According to my dreams.
[02:14:44.200 --> 02:14:48.200]  Something that.
[02:14:48.200 --> 02:14:53.200]  The cat.
[02:14:53.200 --> 02:14:57.200]  Just an angry little cat.
[02:14:57.200 --> 02:15:00.200]  Suspicious.
[02:15:00.200 --> 02:15:06.200]  We probably at this point like on a branch above you with a knife and you just have no idea.
[02:15:06.200 --> 02:15:10.200]  I. He is ready to strike.
[02:15:10.200 --> 02:15:17.200]  In my dreams, I hear about a thing that perverts the flesh.
[02:15:17.200 --> 02:15:22.200]  That will get probably everyone's attention.
[02:15:22.200 --> 02:15:29.200]  And her scene doesn't appreciate his quarry being metal.
[02:15:29.200 --> 02:15:36.200]  So I come to stop the thing messing with our.
[02:15:36.200 --> 02:15:39.200]  Why constantly?
[02:15:39.200 --> 02:15:43.200]  Are you talking about the net that just kind of live there right now?
[02:15:43.200 --> 02:15:44.200]  Yes.
[02:15:44.200 --> 02:15:47.200]  Yes. Yeah, I know.
[02:15:47.200 --> 02:15:48.200]  I'm sorry.
[02:15:48.200 --> 02:15:50.200]  Those can be horrible.
[02:15:50.200 --> 02:15:52.200]  Hold on. Just just gesture to the cart.
[02:15:52.200 --> 02:15:57.200]  Like kind of we found it.
[02:15:57.200 --> 02:16:03.200]  It seems like it might be a problem.
[02:16:03.200 --> 02:16:08.200]  Taking it on physically.
[02:16:08.200 --> 02:16:10.200]  Am I right?
[02:16:10.200 --> 02:16:11.200]  Vespera.
[02:16:11.200 --> 02:16:13.200]  Yes.
[02:16:13.200 --> 02:16:15.200]  Killing the thing.
[02:16:15.200 --> 02:16:17.200]  Got any ideas?
[02:16:17.200 --> 02:16:18.200]  I'm on it.
[02:16:18.200 --> 02:16:23.200]  It's it's my job now.
[02:16:23.200 --> 02:16:29.200]  Did you have a plan at the moment or no, no, I need to learn how to.
[02:16:29.200 --> 02:16:31.200]  He gave me all the information.
[02:16:31.200 --> 02:16:38.200]  I feel like yours and my interests are somewhat aligned.
[02:16:38.200 --> 02:16:43.200]  If you want to help us, I'll tolerate you.
[02:16:43.200 --> 02:16:47.200]  I'll do what I can.
[02:16:47.200 --> 02:16:52.200]  But as I said, you smell of sorrow and pain.
[02:16:52.200 --> 02:16:53.200]  And sewage.
[02:16:53.200 --> 02:16:56.200]  And sewage.
[02:16:56.200 --> 02:16:57.200]  Go take a shower.
[02:16:57.200 --> 02:17:00.200]  Go take a shower.
[02:17:00.200 --> 02:17:02.200]  I'm in my depression stage.
[02:17:02.200 --> 02:17:04.200]  That means no shower.
[02:17:04.200 --> 02:17:10.200]  Kim has said we have not come across the stream, lake, river, you name it.
[02:17:10.200 --> 02:17:19.200]  Now, I believe that you all were headed somewhere.
[02:17:19.200 --> 02:17:22.200]  I just played the tower.
[02:17:22.200 --> 02:17:27.200]  So we're coming up on the city.
[02:17:27.200 --> 02:17:31.200]  I was hoping to go there.
[02:17:31.200 --> 02:17:35.200]  If you know where the lake is, I will let you come with us anywhere.
[02:17:35.200 --> 02:17:41.200]  The city itself has been by the lake.
[02:17:41.200 --> 02:17:43.200]  Is it full of alligators?
[02:17:43.200 --> 02:17:48.200]  No, a lot of fish.
[02:17:48.200 --> 02:17:50.200]  And mud crabs.
[02:17:50.200 --> 02:17:53.200]  Mud crabs are harmless, basically.
[02:17:53.200 --> 02:18:00.200]  I love the mud crab swearing mod.
[02:18:00.200 --> 02:18:02.200]  What mod is it?
[02:18:02.200 --> 02:18:08.200]  A mod that makes mud crabs swear when you hit them.
[02:18:08.200 --> 02:18:13.200]  I love that mod. That mod's very funny.
[02:18:13.200 --> 02:18:18.200]  I love shooting them with ranged spells or arrows because they ragdoll and go flying and it's hilarious.
[02:18:18.200 --> 02:18:21.200]  I need to play more Oblivion.
[02:18:21.200 --> 02:18:29.200]  I got the original Oblivion on PC.
[02:18:29.200 --> 02:18:33.200]  Are y'all heading out anytime soon?
[02:18:33.200 --> 02:18:37.200]  Only after this night. It is night, right?
[02:18:37.200 --> 02:18:45.200]  It's getting into the evening.
[02:18:45.200 --> 02:18:47.200]  Twilight, if you will.
[02:18:47.200 --> 02:18:50.200]  Twilight is a better way of putting it.
[02:18:50.200 --> 02:18:52.200]  In the morning, we'll break camp.
[02:18:52.200 --> 02:18:56.200]  Werewolves and vampires, no?
[02:18:56.200 --> 02:19:00.200]  I'm ignoring all the Twilight references because I'm already eating the wolf.
[02:19:00.200 --> 02:19:06.200]  No!
[02:19:06.200 --> 02:19:11.200]  Is Tessandra, do you glisten in the moonlight?
[02:19:11.200 --> 02:19:13.200]  Does Tessandra what now?
[02:19:13.200 --> 02:19:16.200]  Glisten in the moonlight?
[02:19:16.200 --> 02:19:18.200]  That would be my character.
[02:19:18.200 --> 02:19:25.200]  If he did, he would have to end up getting all the fur off of him first so he could end up seeing the skin.
[02:19:25.200 --> 02:19:32.200]  We know you're an alien, so do you have the feet that make you get more empowered?
[02:19:32.200 --> 02:19:36.200]  I know I did get that feet. Let me look for it.
[02:19:36.200 --> 02:19:53.200]  Empowered by Starlight, the alien character treats the real power bonus as being too high for the purpose of all spell resistance or restraint while under direct Starlight.
[02:19:53.200 --> 02:19:58.200]  The alien can choose for...
[02:19:58.200 --> 02:20:08.200]  that? This bonus for the rest of the night in order to absorb some of the power rating down on them.
[02:20:08.200 --> 02:20:13.200]  We're getting 15 Magicka instead.
[02:20:13.200 --> 02:20:14.200]  That's it.
[02:20:14.200 --> 02:20:18.200]  I think there is a talent that lets you have it be included as three-higher.
[02:20:18.200 --> 02:20:20.200]  A saint.
[02:20:20.200 --> 02:20:26.200]  Yeah, there is. So if you guys didn't know, there are racial-specific talents you guys can take based on your race.
[02:20:26.200 --> 02:20:33.200]  For the Altmer, it makes their power well better. For Aliens, it makes their Empowered by Starlight better.
[02:20:33.200 --> 02:20:37.200]  I think the Orc one gives them higher toughness.
[02:20:37.200 --> 02:20:47.200]  I did get that talent from the Aliens. I just can't read all of it because it does not show me everything on the talents.
[02:20:47.200 --> 02:20:51.200]  Gotcha. Give me a moment then.
[02:20:51.200 --> 02:20:55.200]  Oh, you know, let me look on your... it shows up on Foundry.
[02:20:55.200 --> 02:20:57.200]  Yeah, but when it's in...
[02:20:57.200 --> 02:20:58.200]  On the sheet.
[02:20:58.200 --> 02:21:02.200]  Yeah, when it's on the sheet, I can't...
[02:21:02.200 --> 02:21:08.200]  You just have to drag that line down further on the Excel sheet to make it be a bigger box.
[02:21:08.200 --> 02:21:10.200]  Wait, I can do that?
[02:21:10.200 --> 02:21:11.200]  Yep.
[02:21:11.200 --> 02:21:12.200]  Yeah.
[02:21:12.200 --> 02:21:15.200]  Oh, I didn't know that.
[02:21:15.200 --> 02:21:19.200]  But it kind of, like...
[02:21:19.200 --> 02:21:22.200]  Yeah, it's not perfect.
[02:21:22.200 --> 02:21:30.200]  Unfortunately, like, that's just the nature of Excel. I'll show you how to do it.
[02:21:30.200 --> 02:21:33.200]  I didn't realize it wasn't showing it for some reason, but now it's perfect.
[02:21:33.200 --> 02:21:37.200]  Also, I think I know why it's doing that. So it's Lord of the Nibian.
[02:21:37.200 --> 02:21:42.200]  So the spacing on it's weird.
[02:21:42.200 --> 02:21:44.200]  Besides, let me fix that real quick.
[02:21:44.200 --> 02:21:45.200]  Okay.
[02:21:45.200 --> 02:21:49.200]  I can fix it. If you want to keep us going on this, I can extend it to 100.
[02:21:49.200 --> 02:21:52.200]  Oh, this is like a two second fix.
[02:21:52.200 --> 02:21:54.200]  Yeah, it's already done.
[02:21:54.200 --> 02:21:56.200]  Oh, okay.
[02:21:56.200 --> 02:22:01.200]  So when we rest, does the decendant come down from the tree?
[02:22:01.200 --> 02:22:05.200]  Or does he just stare at me?
[02:22:05.200 --> 02:22:18.200]  Oh, he's staring at you throughout the night, ready to strike, should you end up showing any form of, like, potential to harm his party, especially after having just lost one of them.
[02:22:18.200 --> 02:22:22.200]  Hold is definitely spooning a spear tonight.
[02:22:22.200 --> 02:22:28.200]  That's another character I gotta make. Okay.
[02:22:28.200 --> 02:22:30.200]  Oh, Cole wanted to do something.
[02:22:30.200 --> 02:22:42.200]  I would like to skip to you and say thank you for being our friend. I like you. And I'm just going to skip away.
[02:22:42.200 --> 02:22:44.200]  My character?
[02:22:44.200 --> 02:22:45.200]  Yeah.
[02:22:45.200 --> 02:22:51.200]  I realized how your character is. You're like Jester from Campaign 2. That's what you are.
[02:22:51.200 --> 02:22:53.200]  Oh my god, yes.
[02:22:53.200 --> 02:22:56.200]  I'm already doing it, I don't know.
[02:22:56.200 --> 02:22:59.200]  All you gotta do is draw dick figures and you'll be fine.
[02:22:59.200 --> 02:23:03.200]  Oh, don't worry. They are animating that series now.
[02:23:03.200 --> 02:23:05.200]  So, or they're in the very bottom.
[02:23:05.200 --> 02:23:06.200]  Yay!
[02:23:06.200 --> 02:23:14.200]  I do fully suggest listening to it because they've already changed a lot of the actual story in just the teasers they've shown us for the animation.
[02:23:14.200 --> 02:23:17.200]  I like you.
[02:23:17.200 --> 02:23:22.200]  They managed to keep the story with Vox Machina surprising the entire party.
[02:23:22.200 --> 02:23:33.200]  They got rid of Tiberius, they got rid of... they changed some things, but none of them were bad changes in my opinion so far.
[02:23:33.200 --> 02:23:36.200]  The heart of the story was still there.
[02:23:36.200 --> 02:23:37.200]  Yes.
[02:23:37.200 --> 02:23:38.200]  But...
[02:23:38.200 --> 02:23:39.200]  Sorry.
[02:23:39.200 --> 02:23:43.200]  They also incorporated stuff from campaigns that happened later.
[02:23:43.200 --> 02:23:44.200]  Yeah.
[02:23:44.200 --> 02:23:46.200]  And had references, which was nice.
[02:23:46.200 --> 02:23:47.200]  Yeah.
[02:23:47.200 --> 02:23:48.200]  But...
[02:23:48.200 --> 02:23:50.200]  So we rest.
[02:23:50.200 --> 02:23:53.200]  Yeah. Coral doesn't know any better, she likes you.
[02:23:53.200 --> 02:23:59.200]  She is the childhood group and we must protect her.
[02:23:59.200 --> 02:24:03.200]  Yeah, I'm glad that's Coral.
[02:24:03.200 --> 02:24:05.200]  Maddie, I have a chip for you.
[02:24:05.200 --> 02:24:09.200]  He seems... a little too friendly.
[02:24:09.200 --> 02:24:16.200]  She's very childish, she's still learning about the world.
[02:24:16.200 --> 02:24:20.200]  Everyone has your best interests at heart.
[02:24:20.200 --> 02:24:22.200]  *laughs*
[02:24:22.200 --> 02:24:26.200]  Oh, but don't get her angry, you're actually terrifying, Maddie.
[02:24:26.200 --> 02:24:30.200]  Why do you call her that?
[02:24:30.200 --> 02:24:34.200]  You can't do so much like Jester.
[02:24:34.200 --> 02:24:39.200]  And the one you don't see likes to stab people in the neck and steal their things.
[02:24:39.200 --> 02:24:42.200]  Like their blood.
[02:24:42.200 --> 02:24:45.200]  Like their blood.
[02:24:45.200 --> 02:24:52.200]  And also, this Benny, he's chill. He's good.
[02:24:52.200 --> 02:24:57.200]  Oh, and it's Halda by the way, she wanders off to get ready for bed.
[02:24:57.200 --> 02:25:03.200]  *laughs*
[02:25:03.200 --> 02:25:05.200]  One more time?
[02:25:05.200 --> 02:25:07.200]  I'm just gonna call you Pat.
[02:25:07.200 --> 02:25:11.200]  Bless you, Hoffis Orr.
[02:25:11.200 --> 02:25:15.200]  Hoffis Orr.
[02:25:15.200 --> 02:25:18.200]  I really wanna call you Hoff.
[02:25:18.200 --> 02:25:20.200]  Really, yeah.
[02:25:20.200 --> 02:25:29.200]  Coral will do her best.
[02:25:29.200 --> 02:25:32.200]  Gavin, does that mean anything or no?
[02:25:32.200 --> 02:25:41.200]  It's actually the language used by the Garra lands in Werewolf the Apocalypse for Forsaken...
[02:25:41.200 --> 02:25:43.200]  UFOs.
[02:25:43.200 --> 02:25:45.200]  UFOs, right when you were saying Forsaken.
[02:25:45.200 --> 02:25:48.200]  Forsaken White Wolf.
[02:25:48.200 --> 02:25:50.200]  Also, guys are...
[02:25:50.200 --> 02:25:52.200]  Oh.
[02:25:52.200 --> 02:25:59.200]  One second.
[02:25:59.200 --> 02:26:03.200]  Can't wait to see the session summary on this son of a bitch.
[02:26:03.200 --> 02:26:13.200]  Yeah. We kinda had to do a speedrun on this one.
[02:26:13.200 --> 02:26:20.200]  Alright, so we're gonna go ahead and start wrapping up so we can also do experience.
[02:26:20.200 --> 02:26:26.200]  Because I know Trevor has a timetable that I don't want to interfere with and we got started late today, I apologize guys.
[02:26:26.200 --> 02:26:31.200]  It's my fault, I owe you guys the apology, not Tim, because I was an hour and a half late to the session.
[02:26:31.200 --> 02:26:33.200]  I was an hour late, so don't worry.
[02:26:33.200 --> 02:26:34.200]  Yeah.
[02:26:34.200 --> 02:26:35.200]  Oh, okay, cool.
[02:26:35.200 --> 02:26:37.200]  Ash and I were on time.
[02:26:37.200 --> 02:26:41.200]  They just... they started right before you came in.
[02:26:41.200 --> 02:26:44.200]  The first thing that happened was some opening the Elder Scroll.
[02:26:44.200 --> 02:26:46.200]  That was like the beginning of the session.
[02:26:46.200 --> 02:26:48.200]  You came in like 10 minutes after actual start time.
[02:26:48.200 --> 02:26:50.200]  Yeah.
[02:26:50.200 --> 02:26:53.200]  But I hope you didn't have a beast raising problem.
[02:26:53.200 --> 02:26:56.200]  We did. I was trying to put Maddie down, it just didn't work.
[02:26:56.200 --> 02:27:00.200]  So, I'm just enjoying my life right now.
[02:27:00.200 --> 02:27:01.200]  Kids.
[02:27:01.200 --> 02:27:03.200]  [singing]
[02:27:03.200 --> 02:27:13.200]  But, you guys add him to the rotation of... I guess, nevermind.
[02:27:13.200 --> 02:27:17.200]  Are you guys still... huh?
[02:27:17.200 --> 02:27:19.200]  Is there even a rotation? We have two vampires.
[02:27:19.200 --> 02:27:24.200]  That's why I say, would you have rotation?
[02:27:24.200 --> 02:27:29.200]  Fair enough. I'm not used to having characters who can't sleep, so it's not my first initial thought.
[02:27:29.200 --> 02:27:32.200]  Yeah.
[02:27:32.200 --> 02:27:38.200]  My character is happy to stay awake. Not me, but my character.
[02:27:38.200 --> 02:27:41.200]  I can't really sleep that easy.
[02:27:41.200 --> 02:27:47.200]  Benny will say, I can stay up. You guys get some sleep.
[02:27:47.200 --> 02:27:52.200]  Tessentra is watching somewhere, and you're like, caught to the middle of nowhere.
[02:27:52.200 --> 02:27:58.200]  Tessentra is a boy.
[02:27:58.200 --> 02:28:03.200]  Benny will get up out of the cart. He'll get on top of the cart.
[02:28:03.200 --> 02:28:06.200]  And just keep an eye out.
[02:28:06.200 --> 02:28:09.200]  Trading off like, hey, I'll watch for an hour, you watch for an hour.
[02:28:09.200 --> 02:28:11.200]  Tessentra is like, that way, like...
[02:28:11.200 --> 02:28:16.200]  If you're sitting there doing watch for forever, you're not gonna see anything.
[02:28:16.200 --> 02:28:18.200]  You gotta switch out.
[02:28:18.200 --> 02:28:21.200]  Regardless of if you need sleep or not.
[02:28:21.200 --> 02:28:26.200]  Although I guess not having to sleep would make that a bit easier.
[02:28:26.200 --> 02:28:29.200]  Yeah, you're not gonna get tired.
[02:28:29.200 --> 02:28:30.200]  You get bored.
[02:28:30.200 --> 02:28:31.200]  You get bored, yeah.
[02:28:31.200 --> 02:28:36.200]  Well, it's also like, if you're just staring, especially when you're like, doing like, pulling security in the woods.
[02:28:36.200 --> 02:28:37.200]  You see shit.
[02:28:37.200 --> 02:28:41.200]  Yeah, everything just starts blending together, and you start seeing shit. That's not there.
[02:28:41.200 --> 02:28:42.200]  Yeah.
[02:28:42.200 --> 02:28:47.200]  You wouldn't get that as much if you're tired, if you're not tired, because part of that is just being confident.
[02:28:47.200 --> 02:28:52.200]  Yeah, I don't know. Either way, the two of them pull shifts.
[02:28:52.200 --> 02:28:54.200]  We'll just say boredom.
[02:28:54.200 --> 02:28:59.200]  Yeah, we'll say boredom.
[02:28:59.200 --> 02:29:05.200]  Um, okay.
[02:29:05.200 --> 02:29:07.200]  Sure, spell it first.
[02:29:07.200 --> 02:29:08.200]  Sleeping.
[02:29:08.200 --> 02:29:18.200]  You guys go throughout the night. This road has been really quiet since everything's been going on.
[02:29:18.200 --> 02:29:27.200]  Last you heard as you were heading out of the Imperial City that they were sending people there, but they were first going to focus on getting the refugees that would be coming.
[02:29:27.200 --> 02:29:39.200]  A lot of the, especially the people who are here are members of the Major's Guild, the Arcane University.
[02:29:39.200 --> 02:29:41.200]  You and Coral.
[02:29:41.200 --> 02:29:42.200]  Oh yeah.
[02:29:42.200 --> 02:29:43.200]  Hi.
[02:29:43.200 --> 02:29:46.200]  I wasn't sure about Coral.
[02:29:46.200 --> 02:30:04.200]  But you would know that the Arcane University received a few of the mages that were in Kvatch that teleported ahead as a way to get word here to the Imperial City quicker.
[02:30:04.200 --> 02:30:13.200]  Thankfully the spell or the ritual does not require like a set out space. They just usually have one. You can in theory do it anywhere.
[02:30:13.200 --> 02:30:22.200]  And technically if you have a mark set somewhere, you can just teleport somewhere.
[02:30:22.200 --> 02:30:28.200]  And they definitely would have one in the Imperial Palace, or the Imperial City rather.
[02:30:28.200 --> 02:30:35.200]  But you guys rest of the night and then begin on the road once more.
[02:30:35.200 --> 02:30:38.200]  On the road again.
[02:30:38.200 --> 02:30:39.200]  Sorry, I thought I was muted.
[02:30:39.200 --> 02:30:43.200]  I can't say anything about having a reference to a song.
[02:30:43.200 --> 02:30:46.200]  Don't worry, I thought the same thing.
[02:30:46.200 --> 02:30:49.200]  I only got it once whenever I say country road.
[02:30:49.200 --> 02:30:56.200]  Country road, take me home.
[02:30:56.200 --> 02:30:59.200]  Where I belong.
[02:30:59.200 --> 02:31:01.200]  Where's Virginia?
[02:31:01.200 --> 02:31:04.200]  I can't get that.
[02:31:04.200 --> 02:31:05.200]  That's another one.
[02:31:05.200 --> 02:31:08.200]  I'm aware, that's why I said it.
[02:31:08.200 --> 02:31:11.200]  I'm playing through Vegas right now.
[02:31:11.200 --> 02:31:13.200]  I'm aware.
[02:31:13.200 --> 02:31:16.200]  Because we're making our way to the Imperial City.
[02:31:16.200 --> 02:31:19.200]  Downtown.
[02:31:19.200 --> 02:31:28.200]  As you guys are traveling down the gold road to the Imperial City, or you guys have already passed Skyngram by this point.
[02:31:28.200 --> 02:31:31.200]  You ever been called?
[02:31:31.200 --> 02:31:42.200]  By this point, the refugees have beat you back, or beaten you to the city.
[02:31:42.200 --> 02:31:47.200]  You...
[02:31:47.200 --> 02:31:59.200]  The first thing you notice as you're coming up to the city is, on the other side of the bridge, opposite of where the city itself is,
[02:31:59.200 --> 02:32:04.200]  there are a number of small camps that are sprouted up.
[02:32:04.200 --> 02:32:07.200]  Small little shanty towns for a lot of the refugees.
[02:32:07.200 --> 02:32:15.200]  As you make your way through the gates, take your carriage.
[02:32:15.200 --> 02:32:19.200]  Do you want me to make a detour to the moat real quick?
[02:32:19.200 --> 02:32:21.200]  To the moat?
[02:32:21.200 --> 02:32:23.200]  You still have to go that way.
[02:32:23.200 --> 02:32:26.200]  Oh yeah, that's fair.
[02:32:26.200 --> 02:32:32.200]  You guys can easily go and wash up after everything has gone down.
[02:32:32.200 --> 02:32:35.200]  I would like to dive in.
[02:32:35.200 --> 02:32:36.200]  Okay.
[02:32:36.200 --> 02:32:42.200]  Yay! Thanks babe.
[02:32:42.200 --> 02:32:46.200]  I finally get to see the cat on Holda's shoulder.
[02:32:46.200 --> 02:32:50.200]  The one that has been threatening you this whole time.
[02:32:50.200 --> 02:32:56.200]  You'll... you'll at some point notice there's a cat just sitting on my shoulder.
[02:32:56.200 --> 02:32:57.200]  Yeah.
[02:32:57.200 --> 02:33:01.200]  It's like he's pulled in a little fur crook.
[02:33:01.200 --> 02:33:04.200]  You want to get down? You want to go see Pops?
[02:33:04.200 --> 02:33:06.200]  Go see Pops.
[02:33:06.200 --> 02:33:09.200]  She loves her Pops.
[02:33:09.200 --> 02:33:14.200]  Aww.
[02:33:14.200 --> 02:33:15.200]  Um, but...
[02:33:15.200 --> 02:33:17.200]  Do you have trouble with the gate?
[02:33:17.200 --> 02:33:23.200]  No, I have no trouble with the gate. They've been letting in some people here.
[02:33:23.200 --> 02:33:28.200]  They're doing the standard checks of characters coming through that they would do normally.
[02:33:28.200 --> 02:33:34.200]  There also has been a recent break in at the Imperial Palace.
[02:33:34.200 --> 02:33:36.200]  So they are...
[02:33:36.200 --> 02:33:38.200]  [inaudible]
[02:33:38.200 --> 02:33:40.200]  A little bit more on edge.
[02:33:40.200 --> 02:33:43.200]  Alright, let's just go do it.
[02:33:43.200 --> 02:33:48.200]  [inaudible]
[02:33:48.200 --> 02:33:49.200]  We were in cut.
[02:33:49.200 --> 02:33:50.200]  We could have done that.
[02:33:50.200 --> 02:33:55.200]  We could have evolved, I believe.
[02:33:55.200 --> 02:33:56.200]  Uh...
[02:33:56.200 --> 02:33:58.200]  [laughter]
[02:33:58.200 --> 02:34:02.200]  Um, but, uh...
[02:34:02.200 --> 02:34:06.200]  You go through the checks. They see that you were carrying a dead body.
[02:34:06.200 --> 02:34:08.200]  Mm-hmm.
[02:34:08.200 --> 02:34:12.200]  Um...
[02:34:12.200 --> 02:34:15.200]  What happened?
[02:34:15.200 --> 02:34:17.200]  Casualty...
[02:34:17.200 --> 02:34:20.200]  This used to be his...
[02:34:20.200 --> 02:34:23.200]  This used to be his home.
[02:34:23.200 --> 02:34:25.200]  Yep.
[02:34:25.200 --> 02:34:27.200]  Ah.
[02:34:27.200 --> 02:34:29.200]  Well, um...
[02:34:29.200 --> 02:34:32.200]  If you go to the Temple District...
[02:34:32.200 --> 02:34:33.200]  Um...
[02:34:33.200 --> 02:34:35.200]  Do you know which...
[02:34:35.200 --> 02:34:37.200]  Of the nine he...
[02:34:37.200 --> 02:34:45.200]  I'm really worshiped each of them have their own cemeteries.
[02:34:45.200 --> 02:34:47.200]  Technically...
[02:34:47.200 --> 02:34:49.200]  He didn't really...
[02:34:49.200 --> 02:34:53.200]  He didn't talk about his religion.
[02:34:53.200 --> 02:34:59.200]  Uh, they should be able to help you find the right place to bury him and go through the process with him. With you.
[02:34:59.200 --> 02:35:04.200]  I'll...
[02:35:04.200 --> 02:35:08.200]  I... I want to ask some questions.
[02:35:08.200 --> 02:35:11.200]  I'm sure they can help you.
[02:35:11.200 --> 02:35:16.200]  And, uh, the guard does say, "I'm sorry for your loss."
[02:35:16.200 --> 02:35:17.200]  Yeah.
[02:35:17.200 --> 02:35:19.200]  Yeah, you're fly.
[02:35:19.200 --> 02:35:22.200]  Okay, guide him.
[02:35:22.200 --> 02:35:30.200]  I... I... I hope to see him... after.
[02:35:30.200 --> 02:35:35.200]  I'll be able to.
[02:35:35.200 --> 02:35:40.200]  And he'll politely, gently, but...
[02:35:40.200 --> 02:35:44.200]  Gently but firmly kind of guide you guys through taking on the next group.
[02:35:44.200 --> 02:35:48.200]  But he... the one guard is... he's generally like, "I'm very sorry."
[02:35:48.200 --> 02:35:51.200]  He seems very genuine in what he's saying.
[02:35:51.200 --> 02:35:56.200]  He's probably met a lot of bodies in the last week from the botched...
[02:35:56.200 --> 02:36:01.200]  He will say, "The Temple District is a bit chaotic right now.
[02:36:01.200 --> 02:36:08.200]  Many refugees have flocked to that area, and this won't be the first funeral this week."
[02:36:08.200 --> 02:36:10.200]  I figured.
[02:36:10.200 --> 02:36:16.200]  As long as I can pay him... pay his respect.
[02:36:16.200 --> 02:36:21.200]  It's the last thing I can do.
[02:36:21.200 --> 02:36:25.200]  Um...
[02:36:25.200 --> 02:36:28.200]  How long did you die?
[02:36:28.200 --> 02:36:31.200]  About five days.
[02:36:31.200 --> 02:36:40.200]  Kind of pulls the cover up.
[02:36:40.200 --> 02:36:44.200]  Did anyone... have you already involved him?
[02:36:44.200 --> 02:36:47.200]  Has anyone cast something to...
[02:36:47.200 --> 02:36:53.200]  Um, somebody did... uh, there's something for him.
[02:36:53.200 --> 02:36:56.200]  Like when he died.
[02:36:56.200 --> 02:36:58.200]  Yes.
[02:36:58.200 --> 02:37:02.200]  Okay. I just... looks very fresh.
[02:37:02.200 --> 02:37:09.200]  He realized what he just said, he was like, "I'm sorry."
[02:37:09.200 --> 02:37:12.200]  I go, "Let us go by."
[02:37:12.200 --> 02:37:16.200]  He looks pretty fresh.
[02:37:16.200 --> 02:37:18.200]  Fresh.
[02:37:18.200 --> 02:37:22.200]  He'll like awkwardly like, "I just fucked up, I said the wrong thing, I'm sorry."
[02:37:22.200 --> 02:37:25.200]  I go, "Hey, I'm like..."
[02:37:25.200 --> 02:37:32.200]  Very good, because there's no way they would remember to be searching Tessandra for the Elder Scroll of his backpack right now.
[02:37:32.200 --> 02:37:35.200]  Get with the theory.
[02:37:35.200 --> 02:37:39.200]  They did not do your job.
[02:37:39.200 --> 02:37:48.200]  Actually, at some point when we're not in your guard, Tessandra, they're on alert. Is that for your scroll thing?
[02:37:48.200 --> 02:37:54.200]  Likely, but will not catch.
[02:37:54.200 --> 02:37:59.200]  Not when I eat this Elder Scroll.
[02:37:59.200 --> 02:38:08.200]  They're all Fungad Hassa. One who's stupid.
[02:38:08.200 --> 02:38:11.200]  Well, they didn't even bother to search that box.
[02:38:11.200 --> 02:38:13.200]  Yeah, I'll agree with you on that one.
[02:38:13.200 --> 02:38:16.200]  Wait, what?
[02:38:16.200 --> 02:38:20.200]  And where do you guys head to? Right after this.
[02:38:20.200 --> 02:38:24.200]  Probably the Temple District.
[02:38:24.200 --> 02:38:29.200]  So you guys begin making your way to the Temple District.
[02:38:29.200 --> 02:38:32.200]  And that is where we will end today's session.
[02:38:32.200 --> 02:38:33.200]  Yep.
[02:38:33.200 --> 02:38:35.200]  Before getting to anything else.
[02:38:35.200 --> 02:38:43.200]  Who would like to award experience to whom? I'm going to start off at the top with Coral.
[02:38:43.200 --> 02:38:45.200]  Hello.
[02:38:45.200 --> 02:38:47.200]  Jester.
[02:38:47.200 --> 02:38:50.200]  Um, Lespera.
[02:38:50.200 --> 02:38:53.200]  For all the sadness she is going through.
[02:38:53.200 --> 02:38:58.200]  And to help lift her spirits a little bit.
[02:38:58.200 --> 02:39:02.200]  And make sure you can get the Elite of Answer going for it.
[02:39:02.200 --> 02:39:09.200]  Oh yeah, I have enough experience after this session.
[02:39:09.200 --> 02:39:15.200]  Speaking of which, Tymone have to message you soon about how you want to plan to do mine.
[02:39:15.200 --> 02:39:18.200]  Thought you well.
[02:39:18.200 --> 02:39:23.200]  We gotta do my one on one thing.
[02:39:23.200 --> 02:39:25.200]  Tymone?
[02:39:25.200 --> 02:39:27.200]  Whisper, whisper.
[02:39:27.200 --> 02:39:29.200]  Whisper.
[02:39:29.200 --> 02:39:31.200]  Um.
[02:39:31.200 --> 02:39:33.200]  Noises.
[02:39:33.200 --> 02:39:34.200]  Dog.
[02:39:34.200 --> 02:39:38.200]  Oh my god, shut up.
[02:39:38.200 --> 02:39:42.200]  That dog tiny was barking.
[02:39:42.200 --> 02:39:45.200]  He's barking to the dogs that are in the backyard.
[02:39:45.200 --> 02:39:48.200]  Hapis or?
[02:39:48.200 --> 02:39:51.200]  Who would you like to award experience to?
[02:39:51.200 --> 02:39:53.200]  Uh, to Cendra.
[02:39:53.200 --> 02:39:58.200]  For a genuinely sad moment.
[02:39:58.200 --> 02:39:59.200]  Huh?
[02:39:59.200 --> 02:40:01.200]  Uh, Holda?
[02:40:01.200 --> 02:40:09.200]  I'm giving my decoral for the sheer lack of self preservation to walk up to a complete stranger who is a werewolf at the time.
[02:40:09.200 --> 02:40:11.200]  Like, "Hi, I like you!"
[02:40:11.200 --> 02:40:14.200]  Thank you!
[02:40:14.200 --> 02:40:17.200]  I never said I was smart.
[02:40:17.200 --> 02:40:22.200]  I hate it.
[02:40:22.200 --> 02:40:23.200]  I hate it.
[02:40:23.200 --> 02:40:25.200]  Trevor.
[02:40:25.200 --> 02:40:30.200]  Trevor, okay.
[02:40:30.200 --> 02:40:32.200]  I love Mad Cat.
[02:40:32.200 --> 02:40:33.200]  Uh, Jack?
[02:40:33.200 --> 02:40:37.200]  I feel bad because mine's also playing a Trevor for reading The Elder Scroll.
[02:40:37.200 --> 02:40:38.200]  Like a G.
[02:40:38.200 --> 02:40:41.200]  That was pretty bad A, yes.
[02:40:41.200 --> 02:40:44.200]  And succeeding where my character failed.
[02:40:44.200 --> 02:40:45.200]  Yeah.
[02:40:45.200 --> 02:40:46.200]  Really?
[02:40:46.200 --> 02:40:48.200]  Yeah, he is blind.
[02:40:48.200 --> 02:40:51.200]  He has blind and lingering injuries because he read The Elder Scroll.
[02:40:51.200 --> 02:40:52.200]  Oh no.
[02:40:52.200 --> 02:40:53.200]  Read An Elder Scroll.
[02:40:53.200 --> 02:40:55.200]  That is unfortunate.
[02:40:55.200 --> 02:41:00.200]  Which by the way, just for perspective, I was figuring this out when we were doing the heist.
[02:41:00.200 --> 02:41:08.200]  At the time of the third era, at the time of Oblivion, there were 317 Elder Scrolls in the...
[02:41:08.200 --> 02:41:14.200]  Sorry, well, now 316.
[02:41:14.200 --> 02:41:17.200]  Now there's one less.
[02:41:17.200 --> 02:41:20.200]  But still, that is a lot!
[02:41:20.200 --> 02:41:22.200]  They do go missing.
[02:41:22.200 --> 02:41:28.200]  Uh, it's around the time of the Great War.
[02:41:28.200 --> 02:41:31.200]  Like every single one just gone.
[02:41:31.200 --> 02:41:34.200]  I forgot that I had parsley powder.
[02:41:34.200 --> 02:41:36.200]  No one knows that happened.
[02:41:36.200 --> 02:41:41.200]  I mean, they're mystical artifacts that can kind of...
[02:41:41.200 --> 02:41:43.200]  I think a sneaky little Khajiit haven't.
[02:41:43.200 --> 02:41:47.200]  Just under who would you like to award experience to?
[02:41:47.200 --> 02:41:53.200]  I also have to give mine to Vespera in particular for sharing the sad moment.
[02:41:53.200 --> 02:41:57.200]  You mean hugging your character and just crying?
[02:41:57.200 --> 02:41:58.200]  Yep.
[02:41:58.200 --> 02:42:00.200]  And Vespera.
[02:42:00.200 --> 02:42:10.200]  Probably just underrated for just letting my character finally break the fuck down.
[02:42:10.200 --> 02:42:12.200]  Wait, sorry.
[02:42:12.200 --> 02:42:13.200]  I fucked that up.
[02:42:13.200 --> 02:42:17.200]  So Melody for... okay.
[02:42:17.200 --> 02:42:19.200]  Who gave it to Vespera?
[02:42:19.200 --> 02:42:21.200]  I did.
[02:42:21.200 --> 02:42:25.200]  And me.
[02:42:25.200 --> 02:42:27.200]  Was this two?
[02:42:27.200 --> 02:42:29.200]  Yep, it was just us two.
[02:42:29.200 --> 02:42:31.200]  Okay, and then who gave to Trevor?
[02:42:31.200 --> 02:42:33.200]  I know, Jesse?
[02:42:33.200 --> 02:42:34.200]  I did.
[02:42:34.200 --> 02:42:35.200]  Robert.
[02:42:35.200 --> 02:42:40.200]  Robert, Gavin, and Ash.
[02:42:40.200 --> 02:42:44.200]  Okay, well I'm making sure the count was right, so I was right.
[02:42:44.200 --> 02:42:53.200]  And now...
[02:42:53.200 --> 02:42:57.200]  You don't get to.
[02:42:57.200 --> 02:42:59.200]  Yes, I get to award experience.
[02:42:59.200 --> 02:43:12.200]  We will go ahead and give it to...
[02:43:12.200 --> 02:43:14.200]  Half a zerg?
[02:43:14.200 --> 02:43:17.200]  Yep.
[02:43:17.200 --> 02:43:26.200]  Alright, everyone here except for Mitho.
[02:43:26.200 --> 02:43:29.200]  Um, yeah, yeah, true.
[02:43:29.200 --> 02:43:33.200]  Um...
[02:43:33.200 --> 02:43:36.200]  Mitho's in our thoughts.
[02:43:36.200 --> 02:43:38.200]  And prayers.
[02:43:38.200 --> 02:43:39.200]  You know what?
[02:43:39.200 --> 02:43:43.200]  I'm also gonna give one to Mitho.
[02:43:43.200 --> 02:43:46.200]  Oh, you do care.
[02:43:46.200 --> 02:43:50.200]  He's taking the forever nap.
[02:43:50.200 --> 02:43:52.200]  He's going to sleep in the forever box.
[02:43:52.200 --> 02:43:53.200]  Yeah.
[02:43:53.200 --> 02:43:54.200]  Are you okay?
[02:43:54.200 --> 02:43:55.200]  Yep.
[02:43:55.200 --> 02:43:59.200]  I can't wait to see Mitho's funeral.
[02:43:59.200 --> 02:44:07.200]  It's going to be a small, small...
[02:44:07.200 --> 02:44:09.200]  I didn't roll at all today.
[02:44:09.200 --> 02:44:11.200]  Oh, my bad.
[02:44:11.200 --> 02:44:14.200]  We barely rolled.
[02:44:14.200 --> 02:44:17.200]  Why were we falling in the floor?
[02:44:17.200 --> 02:44:21.200]  This was the role playing of the role playing game.
[02:44:21.200 --> 02:44:23.200]  Yeah.
[02:44:23.200 --> 02:44:25.200]  I did that.
[02:44:25.200 --> 02:44:27.200]  Uh...
[02:44:27.200 --> 02:44:29.200]  Mom did a bunch of role playing today.
[02:44:29.200 --> 02:44:31.200]  It was like a good around whole set of things.
[02:44:31.200 --> 02:44:34.200]  Yeah, definitely.
[02:44:34.200 --> 02:44:37.200]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[02:44:37.200 --> 02:44:40.200]  Here you go.
[02:44:40.200 --> 02:44:44.200]  He just hovered and burped on the ground.
[02:44:44.200 --> 02:44:47.200]  Ugh!
[02:44:47.200 --> 02:44:49.200]  Why'd you point it out?
[02:44:49.200 --> 02:44:51.200]  What?
[02:44:51.200 --> 02:44:54.200]  All the fur on her hands.
[02:44:54.200 --> 02:44:58.200]  Unfortunately, our vacuum hasn't been working for the past week and a half.
[02:44:58.200 --> 02:45:00.200]  A week.
[02:45:00.200 --> 02:45:04.200]  For a month, it got horrible.
[02:45:04.200 --> 02:45:08.200]  One of our dogs decided to chew to the cord.
[02:45:08.200 --> 02:45:19.200]  I had to order a replacement outlet or like the bug and spice it and fix it.
[02:45:19.200 --> 02:45:21.200]  Quick, quick.
[02:45:21.200 --> 02:45:30.200]  How do we do the pain sorcery thing and putting a 750 instead?
[02:45:30.200 --> 02:45:35.200]  I think you'll have to do that manually.
[02:45:35.200 --> 02:45:39.200]  Do you want me to put it in right now or do you want to do it?
[02:45:39.200 --> 02:45:40.200]  I gotcha.
[02:45:40.200 --> 02:45:42.200]  Give me a moment.
[02:45:42.200 --> 02:45:44.200]  Uh...
[02:45:44.200 --> 02:45:48.200]  Where are the elite advances listed?
[02:45:48.200 --> 02:45:51.200]  Yeah, it's in character.
[02:45:51.200 --> 02:45:58.200]  No, so there's another page called validation.
[02:45:58.200 --> 02:46:05.200]  Basically I tell the drop down, "Hey, look at this row or this column."
[02:46:05.200 --> 02:46:14.200]  And I have the cell display all the lists so that way if I change or add something to the list, it will add it to it.
[02:46:14.200 --> 02:46:18.200]  But all I gotta do is...
[02:46:18.200 --> 02:46:21.200]  This.
[02:46:21.200 --> 02:46:22.200]  There you go.
[02:46:22.200 --> 02:46:27.200]  And it should be the very bottom for the advanced pain sorcery trained in race.
[02:46:27.200 --> 02:46:29.200]  Snacky lady.
[02:46:29.200 --> 02:46:33.200]  I'm gonna do the same.
[02:46:33.200 --> 02:46:36.200]  Don't worry, you've got plenty of experience.
[02:46:36.200 --> 02:46:37.200]  Yes.
[02:46:37.200 --> 02:46:40.200]  I can't lie to you, mine is called supernaked.
[02:46:40.200 --> 02:46:45.200]  I don't see...
[02:46:45.200 --> 02:46:52.200]  That was positive like 390 or whatever and now it suddenly went to...
[02:46:52.200 --> 02:46:55.200]  Oh.
[02:46:55.200 --> 02:46:58.200]  That was the wrong character sheet.
[02:46:58.200 --> 02:47:01.200]  Oh.
[02:47:01.200 --> 02:47:06.200]  And my phone just died so now I'm on my headset.
[02:47:06.200 --> 02:47:11.200]  That makes more sense.
[02:47:11.200 --> 02:47:14.200]  The lifetime didn't update now.
[02:47:14.200 --> 02:47:18.200]  Oh, you can possibly want to stop the recording.
[02:47:18.200 --> 02:47:23.200]  Oh, cool.
[02:47:23.200 --> 02:47:24.200]  Dope.
[02:47:24.200 --> 02:47:25.200]  Dope.
[02:47:25.200 --> 02:47:26.200]  Dope.
[02:47:28.200 --> 02:47:29.200]  Dope.
